What are you specifically interested in?<br>Well, I've always been interested in helping people and science, so I thought a career in the medical field could be a good fit for me. But I'm not really sure what type of medical career would be the best fit for me. Do you have any recommendations?<br>Sure! There are a lot of different medical careers out there. Have you done any research on specific careers yet?<br>Yeah, I've looked into a few of them, but I'm still not sure which one is right for me.<br>Well, let's talk about some of the options and see if we can narrow it down. For example, what do you think about becoming a doctor?<br>That's definitely something I've considered. But I'm not sure if it's the right fit for me. It seems like a lot of responsibility and it would be a lot of work. Plus, I'm not really sure if I want to deal with sick people all day. Do you think that's something that could change over time?<br>It's possible that your views could change after shadowing or working with doctors and seeing how they help people every day. However, it's also important to consider that becoming a doctor requires many years of schooling and training before you're able to practice on your own. So it's definitely something to think about carefully before making a decision. Are there any other careers you're considering?<br>I've also looked into becoming a nurse. It seems like it would be a good fit for me because I would still be helping people, but I wouldn't have to deal with sick people all day. And the schooling required isn't as long as it is for becoming a doctor.<br>That's true. Nursing is definitely a great career option for someone who wants to help people but doesn't want to deal with sick people all day. And the schooling required is shorter than for becoming a doctor. However, it's important to keep in mind that nurses often work long hours and are on their feet most of the day. So if you're not comfortable with that, then it might not be the right career for you. Are there any other careers you're considering?<br>I've also looked into becoming a physical therapist.
