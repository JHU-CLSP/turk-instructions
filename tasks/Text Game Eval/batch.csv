This story of international intrigue has three chapters, each telling a different piece of the story from a different point of view. You can play each chapter independently, but you will enjoy the story more if you play them in the proper order. If at any time you need to ""pause"" the game and cause the real-time clock to stop running (to get a sandwich or to read a long bit of text), use the PAUSE command.<br><br>The chapters are:<br><br>   Chapter 1: The Train<br>   Chapter 2: The Border<br>   Chapter 3: The Assassination<br><br>Which chapter would you like to play: 1, 2, 3, or (R)estore? >                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Your Compartment        17:26 <br><br>It is always a pleasure to leave Frobnia, and the ride is never over too soon. Sure, a plane would be faster, but as far as reliability goes, well ... better late than never, that's the best rule.<br><br>The train ride from Frzi to Vienna is into its sixth hour, and the train is fast approaching the border of neutral Litzenburg. You can breathe a lot easier there, just knowing that you're out from behind the Iron Curtain. It's even worth the border crossing - guards everywhere, suitcases searched - horrible, really, but there's no use complaining. There are worse countries to be importing goods from - you should know, you've been in most of them.<br><br>Just here, a few miles from the border, night is falling, and the lights of the small villages flicker into existence. You're drifting off into sleep when there is a knock on your compartment door, and a man, clutching his left arm, staggers inside. Drops of blood on his sleeve leave no doubt as to the cause.<br><br>""Don't be frightened,"" he begins, ""I'm all right."" Before you can speak, he begins his story. He is, it seems, an American agent who has just learned of a sinister plot to assassinate a top-ranking American diplomat tomorrow morning in Ostnitz, the town your train is fast approaching. He hands you a document, which he says must be passed to his contact at the train station there. You look through it, but it's all in Frobnian, and you know barely a handful of words - that's why you always carry your combination tourist guide and phrase book with you on your trips here.<br><br>""You must deliver this. I do not know who the contact is - he was supposed to find me. I was to wear this white carnation."" He pulls out the rumpled flower and pins it onto your jacket. ""He will bump into you and greet you with the words 'Forgive me.' to which you should reply 'It is my fault.' Then, hand him the document and earn our country's thanks.""<br><br>He looks quickly over his shoulder - an instinct, perhaps. ""I must be going. You understand."" And with that, he disappears from the compartment.<br><br>Your Compartment        <br><br>This is your compartment on the train to Litzenburg. You were lucky enough to avoid having a roommate on this trip, so the two bench-style seats are more than enough. The compartment itself is quite simple - the two seats on either side, the openable window looking out over the nighttime landscape, the emergency stop cord, the luggage rack. It easily could be worse; this is the first-class car, after all. What little privacy exists on this train is in the form of a door to the east which is now closed. A blood stain is noticeable on the floor here, a grim reminder of the task that lies ahead.<br><br>There is a camera bag and a briefcase here. The camera bag contains a camera and an old roll of film.<br><br>Your Compartment",{},,{},,{},,the character gains some warm clothes,1.0,goodSelf,salient,"The character waits in a hut, seemingly trying to avoid a pack of dogs, before exiting and gaining a parka and some shoes.  They then walk through snow and head into a forest where they find a shed.  Inside the shed they find various items that they try and take but their inventory is full."

In this climate, cold is anywhere below about fifty degrees. Storm clouds are swimming across the sky, their bottoms glowing faintly from the city lights in the distance.

The driver didn't seem to like venturing into this maze of twisty streets any more than you did. But the house windows are full of light, and radio music drifts toward you. Your favorite pistol, a snub-nosed Colt .32, is snug in its holster. You just picked up a match book off the curb. It might come in handy.

He puts handcuffs on the wrists of Michael, who stands stiff and quiet. ""Let's not have any trouble, now,"" says Sergeant Duffy, in his unique way. They head for the driveway, where a police car waits with engine purring.<br><br>Congratulations! Your testimony as star witness for the prosecution secures the conviction of Michael for the first degree murder of his wife, and of Alicia as his accomplice. Not only are they sent to prison with the proverbial key thrown away, but Colonel Marston is convicted in a parallel case of embezzlement and grand theft for his role in the milking of the family Trust.<br><br>Best of all, your syndicated twelve-part story of the tangled plot and its aftermath wins the Pulitzer Prize, and the book is number one on the bestseller lists for 42 weeks! (Not to mention the movie and book club sales.)<br><br>As your book explains, the murder was triggered by Veronica's desire to sell the farm and move to a more rural area. Even with the proceeds of the sale, still more funds from the family Trust would have been required to purchase the new property and build on it. Michael and Colonel Marston were alarmed, as they had been milking the Trust by investing in dummy corporations under their control.

(Not to mention the movie and book club sales.)<br><br>As your book explains, the murder was triggered by Veronica's desire to sell the farm and move to a more rural area. Even with the proceeds of the sale, still more funds from the family Trust would have been required to purchase the new property and build on it. Michael and Colonel Marston were alarmed, as they had been milking the Trust by investing in dummy corporations under their control. After a time, Veronica grew suspicious and had the Trust's dealings investigated. She expected that Colonel Marston would be implicated, but was surprised to find that Michael was an equal partner in the scheme. For Michael, time was running out. He wanted out of the marriage, but not the Ashcroft fortune, and enlisted Alicia's help in the bizarre scheme. Alicia would impersonate the murdered Veronica to establish an alibi.
