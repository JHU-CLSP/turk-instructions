I love her. But when she sees something that is cute or exciting or both, she very loudly makes a sound you'd hope to only hear in your bedroom or in porn. She'll even do it multiple times in a row. Doesn't matter the location. It is super uncomfortable. I'm assuming she is unaware of it. I don't know for sure if everybody else notices what it sounds like, but it makes everyone go quiet for a second. I've known her for several years now, and it seems to be at least a relatively new thing she's been doing.I don't really want to talk about it with our mutual friends, as that feels kind of snakey. I'd rather just talk to her directly. But I'm not sure if I should tell her at all, or if it's something that would be petty and unnecessary to comment on.TL;DR: My friend makes a loud and aggressively erotic sound when she sees something she thinks is cute and it freaks me out. I don't know if I should tell her or just ignore it.","If you are uncomfortable with your friend's behavior, you should definitely say something to her. It's possible that she's unaware of how her sound is being received by others, and it's worth mentioning to her in a kind and supportive way. You could say something like, ""I know you get really excited when you see something cute, but I've noticed that sometimes your sound can be a bit overwhelming. I just wanted to let you know so you can be aware of it in future situations.""","Wait until she does it again and then make a humorous remark to let her how she sounds. EG That ice cream is good, but not orgasm worthy.Easier than a confrontation and less likely to offend her.",2a,helpful,writing

It’s probably best to start when I believe the silent treatment began.My family usually has family dinners everyday. My mom brought up that I should become a nurse so that I could take care of my parents. I have recently changed my mind on what career path I want to follow from nursing to a med tech. My whole family is aware of this. I said that I wouldn’t become a nurse just to take care of them and that I would hire a personal nurse if it ever came to the point they needed help being taken care of. My mom started ranting that their theoretical personal nurse could be a terrible person. I assured her that my sister and I would do our best that they would get the best nurse we can, but my mom still kept insisting that my sister and I take care of them. She kept pushing and saying things like “Oh, so you wouldn’t take care of us?”. Admittedly, I was annoyed and just laughingly said “No, I wouldn’t take care of you”. It was tense for a few moments but dinner resumed as normal with a few passive aggressive comments which is why I am unsure if this event was the cause.The next morning all seemed to be fine until I noticed my mom and dad was ignoring me. Avoiding me and barely speaking to me- the whole silent treatment. And when they do talk, it’s in a very obvious aggressive tone. I have both my parents “Bye, I love you” when leaving for school (as I always do) and they just don’t respond? They just completely ignore me. Every time I have tried to talk to them, I am met with a cold shoulder. They have even stood me up at an event I have planned for some months without even a text.This silent treatment has been going on for days and I’m honestly am tired and really hurt by it. I’m not sure if I’m just overreacting or not but I just want to resolve this whole silent treatment soon. Any advice on how I should deal with this?","First and foremost, it's important to try to communicate with your parents and express your feelings to them. It may be difficult to have a constructive conversation while they are still giving you the silent treatment, but it's important to at least try. If they are unwilling to talk to you, then you can try writing them a letter expressing your thoughts and feelings.It's also important to try to understand their perspective and why they may be upset with you. In this case, it sounds like they may be worried about you not taking care of them in the future. While you may not want to be a nurse, perhaps there are other ways you can show them that you will still be there for them.Finally, it's important to be patient and understanding. Your parents are likely going through their own challenges and stresses, and they may just need some time to cool down. If you can remain calm and understanding, it will be more likely that they will eventually come around.","Your parents are acting like little children and this is emotional abuse. They want you to give in and beg them to talk to you again, or they are waiting for you to say ""fine I'll become a nurse"".DO. NOT. DO. THAT.Play their game. Don't talk to them at all, they are not entitled to you giving up your own life for them. Live your life and find a way to move out. I am sorry but now you have to ""grow-up"" really fast.

Worker discretion is advised.),"Your task is to choose which, of two, advice is better, then justify your decision.","text, nlp, advice",Legal,Former employee is having paranoid delusions and believes my husband is harassing her family and friends,"My husband (Male, 35) used to manage an employee (Female, 40’s) at his company, located in Delaware USA. He has switched jobs and is no longer her manager (changed jobs in June 2019) but still works at the same company. When he changed jobs, he provided his employees with his cell number in case they wanted to keep in touch (it’s a large company) .This employee texted him back in October 2019 asking him if he still lived in the same location (not anywhere near her apartment, but in the same county) because she claimed “I thought I heard and saw you around my apartment.” He jokingly said he may have a doppelgänger and they proceeded to talk about whether he was enjoying his new job. The conversation was very short and uneventful.Today she texted him asking him if he had been in contact with her family and friends (no specific names provided). He replied that he didn’t think he knew any of them.Here’s what she said:“Okay, I don’t really believe you because I have heard you talk about them. You were not supposed to contact them.I have been suspecting that something has been going on between you and my family. I am not accusing you of anything but if what I suspect is true, I don’t appreciate how you are treating me.I just moved here to work for your corporation not to be harassed by you.You were never trying to get me in a team you just wanted to touch everyone in my community. I don’t care if you block me now I just needed to tell you that because you have been continually trying to hurt me when I never tried to hurt you.”We believe she is delusional and paranoid.

I heard kissing noises and was alarmed.Went downstairs and he came down and I asked him if his girlfriend knew she was over and he said no he didn't want her to get mad.I go up to my room to get something then I hear moaning and slapping from the room and feel angry. I opened the door and they were having sex. I was so mad I started shaking. I shouldn't have opened the door but I was so angry that he would shamelessly bring a girl home that wasn't his girlfriend and fuck her with someone in the house.I told my mom because she was home earlier and I told her my concerns about hearing kissing from the room and being concerned. Now she's saying to stay out of it and that we don't know the whole story or both sides.I want to tell her. She deserves to know. I don't want to enable cheating and see her come over and act like nothing happened. She is possessive and controlling at times and my brother says he was stressed and needed to unload and won't cheat again. I call bullshit.

Even when I dressed out for a night, he does not say a thing. At first I thought it's just the way he is, he's just not an verbally expressive type and I was okay with that.However, one day I just looked at him and commented on a whim that he had such a cute face. He insensitively replied with ""unlike you, you're not pretty."" And I was just shocked right there. I thought he was joking or something cause that's such a mean thing to say so I asked whether he really thought that and he said ""Yeah... You're not pretty."" He might have sensed my feeling and added ""You don't have to be pretty, I love you regardless."" I was really hurt then and had no words to say further. That night I came home and cried.I didn't talk to him about how upset he made me felt or anything at all. I feel it is unrealistic for me to wish that he found me ""pretty"" when he just doesn't. Now I just look on the bright side that he is an honest guy who says what he thinks. Well at least he didn't lie. But still I am disgusted at how insensitive his words were. Like if you have nothing nice to say then, well don't say anything.Recently, I caught him looking, I would say staring even, at a friend of ours. We were in the same room and he just kept looking in her direction. She was a girl who, years back before we dated, he would openly compliment on how adorable she was. (And sure enough he had asked her out before we dated where she turned him down.) I was very much disgusted and walked out of the room as soon as I had the chance.

We had been good friends all the way up until freshman year of college where we started dating. Things went pretty fast at that point, we both said we loved each other a little less than a month in, but I mean at that point we’d been close friends for about 13 years. I was 19 and she was 18.When we were juniors in college, I was went with her to visit her older brother whose wife had just recently had a child. We were alone with the baby and he was crying, but she held him, and he almost instantaneously calmed down. I don’t know what exactly it was in that moment, but something about that made me so intensely attracted to her, seeing her do that. That was when I realized she was the person I wanted to spend the rest of my life with without question. We got engaged about a year after college and got married not longer later.Flash forward to now and I work an insanely high stress, high hours office job. For the past seven years, this girl was *exclusively* mine to have and to hold. However, in recent times, due to my hours, I’ve been able to spend way less time with her, so I’d make whatever time we had together really count. She gave birth two months ago. Last week, I came back to our apartment in the middle of the night and saw her sleeping on a sofa holding our son on her chest. I felt such a mix of emotions then. It felt so amazing just to see that scene in and of it self, but I couldn’t help but feel a little bad that I couldn’t hold and cuddle with her like we always used to. It almost felt like I was jealous of my son.With that being said, is it totally unreasonable to feel like this? The jealousy is only a visceral reaction and past that I absolutely love them both with all my heart otherwise. Have any of you ever felt like this?","It's absolutely fine to feel jealous! It's all about how you deal with those emotions. Don't get angry at her or your son. I totally get where you come from mate, I've got 2 kids under 2.

Your wife is now spending a lot of time caring for your son, and you may feel like you're being left out. Try to spend some quality time with your wife when you can, and express your feelings to her.

We had been good friends all the way up until freshman year of college where we started dating. Things went pretty fast at that point, we both said we loved each other a little less than a month in, but I mean at that point we’d been close friends for about 13 years. I was 19 and she was 18.When we were juniors in college, I was went with her to visit her older brother whose wife had just recently had a child. We were alone with the baby and he was crying, but she held him, and he almost instantaneously calmed down. I don’t know what exactly it was in that moment, but something about that made me so intensely attracted to her, seeing her do that. That was when I realized she was the person I wanted to spend the rest of my life with without question. We got engaged about a year after college and got married not longer later.Flash forward to now and I work an insanely high stress, high hours office job. For the past seven years, this girl was *exclusively* mine to have and to hold. However, in recent times, due to my hours, I’ve been able to spend way less time with her, so I’d make whatever time we had together really count. She gave birth two months ago.

Worker discretion is advised.),"Your task is to choose which, of two, advice is better, then justify your decision.","text, nlp, advice",Relationship,I felt forced into a threesome by my gf and a male friend,"Throwaway since all parties involved use reddit. My gf (25f) and I (29m) have been together about 5 years. We were drinking (heavily) with a male friend of mine (27m) one night when he brought up the topic of having a threesome. This had not been the first time he suggested this, and we had turned him down on at least two other occasions. My gf and I had discussed this amongst ourselves before after he initially brought it up and had soundly decided against it. I had initially tried to change subjects, but he was pretty insistent, and my gf chimed in, saying ""hear him out"".I was a little shocked at her response, and didn't know how to react. He kept pushing it, and she seemed interested. I tried protesting this, which was either not heard or ignored. I then tried suggesting we wait for our male friend's gf to come over before starting anything, which I thought was agreed to. But the next thing I know, my gf is asking if we're doing this. All I could really say at this point was ""whatever you want dear"". She proceeds to undress the two of us. At this point I'm catatonic, and couldn't say anything, and couldn't really move much. She then started to try to jam my flaccid wang into herself, and ended up cutting me in a rather sensitive place with her nails. I pushed off of me and went to the bathroom to clean the blood off myself.I stayed in the bathroom a minute or two and worked up the courage to stop things, but when I got back, they were fucking. I panicked again and didn't know what to do, so I suggested we move things to the bedroom. I end up collapsing on our bed, and not moving. They end up fucking over me, and I eventually snap out of it and ask him to leave. He packs up and leaves our place. She then asks why I didn't participate more, and we end up fighting then passing out from the alcohol.The next morning, we tried to patch things up and continue on like nothing happened.

My gf (25f) and I (29m) have been together about 5 years. We were drinking (heavily) with a male friend of mine (27m) one night when he brought up the topic of having a threesome. This had not been the first time he suggested this, and we had turned him down on at least two other occasions. My gf and I had discussed this amongst ourselves before after he initially brought it up and had soundly decided against it. I had initially tried to change subjects, but he was pretty insistent, and my gf chimed in, saying ""hear him out"".I was a little shocked at her response, and didn't know how to react. He kept pushing it, and she seemed interested. I tried protesting this, which was either not heard or ignored. I then tried suggesting we wait for our male friend's gf to come over before starting anything, which I thought was agreed to. But the next thing I know, my gf is asking if we're doing this. All I could really say at this point was ""whatever you want dear"". She proceeds to undress the two of us. At this point I'm catatonic, and couldn't say anything, and couldn't really move much. She then started to try to jam my flaccid wang into herself, and ended up cutting me in a rather sensitive place with her nails. I pushed off of me and went to the bathroom to clean the blood off myself.I stayed in the bathroom a minute or two and worked up the courage to stop things, but when I got back, they were fucking. I panicked again and didn't know what to do, so I suggested we move things to the bedroom. I end up collapsing on our bed, and not moving. They end up fucking over me, and I eventually snap out of it and ask him to leave. He packs up and leaves our place.

Maybe she needs to get off birth control and you could get snipped. That would be a big help.\- have you tried foreplay with visual stimulation (porn she likes). That might help.\- Lube. Use Lube.\- Make sure you are good at sex too.\- is she interested in somebody else? that could be why she's on the phone forgetting herself.\- suggest that you go for counseling/couple's therapy.,2a,helpful,meaning

My house has a hand-laid stone foundation, and as such it has water seep in from rainfall and melting snow. There is a pipe that drains the water from my basement. It goes out the front of my house, crosses a state highway, runs through my neighbors property, and drains into a creek on the backside of his house.

Code enforcement told me that that is legally/reslistically all I could do.Fast forward, new guy moves in, and caps the pipe. He claimed that he didn't know what it was for, and that it smelled bad, so he just decided to cap a drain line with running water and hope for the best. I only found out when I found close to 6 inches of water in the basement.The first time this happened about a month ago, I took the cap off because the water was getting high enough to threaten my water heater and boiler.

Any advice will help I’m at a loss.","If you think your boyfriend may be gay, the best thing you can do is talk to him about it. Let him know that you are supportive and open-minded, and see what he has to say. It's possible that he is just going through a phase or is curious about his sexuality, and in either case, your understanding and support will be appreciated. However, if he is indeed gay, you may need to consider whether or not you want to stay in the relationship. It's ultimately up to you, but if you feel like you are ""trapped"" in the relationship, it may be best to move on.","> I know he had experimented a little with other guysAnd he denies being even ""bi"" or ""bicurious""?Lady this guy is so far in the closet he's in fucking Narnia.",2a,helpful,meaning

I was clocking 2-3 hours a week and helping them with basic tasks such as filing, data entry, and donor outreach. A month or so ago, they informed me that they had grant money that would go to waste if they did not spend it, and offered to hire me as a full time research assistant and would pay me with the grant money. They warned me in advance it would be a temporary position as the grant expired the first of February. I applied for the job internally and received it.Because I was getting paid, I switched from working 2-3 hours a week to 30-40 hours a week. I worked a total of 125 hours over 3 weeks. Today, I discovered that they were not able to ‘add me to the payroll’ on time, according to my supervisor. Because I was going to be paid out of grant money, which has now expired and is inaccessible, they told me there was nothing at all they could do for me and I would not be getting paid.Is this legal? Is there anything I can do to get the money I am owed?","If the clinic is unable to pay you because the grant money has expired, then you may not have any legal recourse. However, you could try speaking to the clinic director or another supervisor to see if they are willing to work out some sort of arrangement. For example, they may be able to pay you in installments or offer you some other form of compensation. If the clinic is unwilling to work with you, then your only other option would be to file a complaint with the Texas labor board.",They owe you the money. Where in the budget they were going to get it is not your problem. File a wage complaint with your states department of labor.,1b,helpful,meaning

I am located in Massachusetts.We have a mentally handicapped person at my workplace. I'm unsure what his condition is, but essentially, he is a man in his 40s who has the emotional and mentalintelligence of someone who's roughly 7 years old. He performs a simple routine task and seems to be relatively content with what he is doing.Since I started, he very quickly took a liking to me and would visit my office often to either chat or ask for help fixing something at his station. Most of the time, there isn't actually anything broken - he either wants me to come over so we can chat or so he can get out of work for a few minutes. Fixing his station is part of my job description, however, some weeks he's calling me over more than 5 times a day to ""fix"" something. Any time we chat, I keep it very light/minimal and limit it to things like weather, sports, music, etc. (ie nothing personal). I figure this is alright so long as he isn't calling me over all the time, as I think he gets lonely at his station.More recently, in the last few months, he found out that I have a boyfriend via another coworker. At this, he became angry, and came to my office to ask about him, saying things like, ""I treat you better than he does, right?"" and ""Dump that asshole, I'll take care of you."" At this point, I asked him to not speak that way about my boyfriend and that I don't like to talk about my personal life at work. He got angry and left my office in a huff. At this point, I talked to his manager about his behavior, and they spoke with him and his representative from the company that placed him with us.Things got better for a little while and he stopped asking me to fix things and coming by my office, and then when his boss was let go, things got bad again. He started coming by every morning asking for hugs and trying to put his arm around my waist any time I was at his station fixing or working on something. I told him not to touch me and that I do not like being touched that way, which would stop the behavior in that moment but I had to repeat this almost daily to him. I mentioned this to his new boss, who seemed uncomfortable reprimanding him because of his disability status.More recently, he has been making comments to people that he's going to ""make me his valentine this year"" and that he's going to ""outdo that other guy on Valentine's day"". Everyone he works with thinks it's cute and harmless because they see him as a child. I know that he is disabled, but I have a hard time seeing him that way when he is trying to put his arm around me, or rub my back, or hug me, as he's old enough to be my father and has at least 200lbs on me. While he isn't violent, he does throw tantrums when he doesn't get what he wants, which generally involve a lot of yelling, swearing, and sometimes pushing things from his workstation onto the floor.It seems like no matter how many times I talk to his boss or recently HR, they are unwilling to reprimand him or do much beyond telling his representative, who hasn't come into the building to speak with him. They've led me to believe that his status essentially makes him legally untouchable, but I have a hard time believing that's true. I get that he has special protections in place due to his disability, but I don't think those protections protect him from reprimand after he continually sexually harasses a coworker.So essentially, what are my options here?TL;DR - Mentally handicapped coworker is sexually harassing me and upper management is unwilling to do anything due to his disability status.

Another option is to file an EEOC complaint, but I don't think that would be very helpful; because you don't appear to have damages at the moment they'd just send you and your employer a letter of dismissal for failure to state a claim, which to your employer may look like vindication of their position.Whatever you do, I think it would be prudent to consult with a local employment attorney about this before doing it. Good luck!",1b,helpful,writing

She told me a few days ago that she needs to sleep with another woman. Before we started dating I knew she identified as being bi-sexual. When we agreed to start dating monogamously, I told her that if we going to date I wanted her to only have sex with me. If she couldn't agree to that, she wouldn't move forward. She did agree. Fast forward 14 years she's told me she needs to sleep with a woman (not a specific woman) just any woman. She hasn't cheated she claims and I believe her. It's obvious we disagree on monogamy. I think it's paramount to a relationship, she feels that an open relationship can be explored. I asked what she means by 'need', like is this an ultimatum. She said she doesn't know. Today she needs to sleep with a woman, tomorrow she may feel differently. I'm against it and feel that I couldn't accept my partner being with another sexually. I don't care that it's a woman. To me, it's a person. I'm not sure what to do. To me, sex is important and has meaning. I have had meaningless sex when I was younger. (I'm 43) but can't see doing it now. To my wife, I think she can separate sex and emotion. Or so she says. I am okay with her being attracted to women but don't want her to act on it. Am I being unfair? Should I allow her to have sex with someone else? I asked her, more hypothetically, could I sleep with another person in that case? She said she didn't think so because I might become attached to that person emotionally. So that's unfair, right?Anyway, I welcome any thoughts. I have no idea what to do. I may or may not be getting a divorce which REALLY sucks. To be clear, she does not want a divorce.","It sounds like you and your wife have very different views on monogamy and what it means to you both. It sounds like you are willing to compromise on some level, but she is not. I think you need to have a conversation about what you are both willing to compromise on. If she is not willing to compromise on anything, then you need to decide if you are willing to stay in the relationship knowing that she will sleep with other people. If you are not willing to stay in the relationship knowing that, then you need to start preparing for a divorce. I'm sorry that this is such a difficult situation.",She wants an open relationship but only SHE can have sex with other people.....Its completely unfair. I don't understand why her wanting to be with a woman is being downplayed. She's bisexual.

The only times I remember getting really sick were at a birthday party, she gave me my medicine and said I could eat whatever I wanted but I got sick and had to go to the hospital, but I got better in the hospital, and last year I got pneumonia and she treated it at home and I got so so so sick I almost died but then I got better in the hospital.- I do have trouble breathing a lot and feel sick a lot but now I have a reason to believe that she's making me sick.So over winter break my family and my best friends family went on a ski trip together and last minute my friends family decided to stay an extra few days but my parents had to go back because my dad had to work. My friends family invited me to stay and after begging and stuff my mom finally gave in and my friend's mom promised to keep my diet and give me all my meds but she's way more laid back than my mom and she would just give me the meds and we were unsupervised a lot. My friend wanted to see what happened if I didn't take my meds and so I didn't and I was fine. Actually I felt better than normal. I ate whatever and never even got a stomach ache and that was when I first started thinking that something was weird.As soon as I came home and went back to normal living with my mom I started getting sick again. Actually I was so sick for the first two weeks I couldn't eat anything and I missed almost the first month back and then when I came back I told my friend and she was jokingly like oh my God what if your mom is gypsy roseing you and I laughed but......I want to know what I should do legally. Can I call the cops on her or cps? Should I talk to a counselor or teacher and let them report it? Sorry if this is the wrong place but since it has to do with something illegal I thought this was best.",Use a pill identifier online to see what the medication is that you are on.I work with all types of people and at your age you should know what your medication is and why you take it.Drugs.com has a pill identifier I use nearly daily .,"If you think your mom is making you sick on purpose, the best thing to do is to talk to a trusted adult about your concerns. This could be a counselor, teacher, doctor, or any other adult who you feel comfortable talking to. They can help you figure out what to do next and can make sure you are safe and healthy.",2b,helpful,meaning

But then, due to mismanagement, they didn't hold up their end of the bargain, and they charged me even though I didn't get the service I wanted. I think this might have been a accident on their part, but I got mad when I saw the charge in the mail then and I forgot about it due to other problems.Then I got a voicemail this morning from someone who claims to be a debt collector, from a business in Illinois called Forest Recovery Services. I don't live in Illinois though, I live in Kentucky, and when I look up their business address on google maps it shows a UPS attached to a Law Firm in the same building. They also have no reviews. I don't know if I should call them back or not, since I hear that can be a way to scam people.Also, while the number the woman called me WITH didn't match the website for Forest Recovery Services, the number she TOLD me to call did.So far I managed to send a voicemail to the people I saw 2 years ago, and I'm waiting for their response. But I'm skeptical of the debt collector and whether I should trust them, and call back. Any help or advice would be appreciated.","I would deffinatly wait till you hear back from the people 2 years ago, they will tell you if anything was sent to collections. usually when debt collectors call they say who they are calling on behalf of, so if they didnt I would be skeptical.","The best thing to do in this situation would be to get in touch with the mental health service that you tried to use 2 years ago. Explain the situation to them and see if they can help you figure out what is going on.

She divorced her ex-husband in Late 2018 and moved to her own place in early 2019. She made a lot of terrible financial decisions while she was living on her own. She was living way beyond her means. She was living in a luxury apartment complex that she couldn't afford and she got a brand-new Mercedes Benz that she couldn't keep up with the payments. Just overall, crazy spending and terrible financial decisions. Apparently, Sometime in March she also had lost her job (I didn't find out about this till WAAAY later), so I have no idea how she was able to keep up with any of her payments.Anyway, fast forward to May 2019 - Finals week is approaching and i'm getting ready for graduation. The weekend before finals week, my mom got hospitalized due to a bad case of unexpected Pneumonia (She has Lupus too, which I think worsened it). Legit thought my mom was going to die. That weekend and finals week was the most stressful and emotionally exhausting period ever. I was juggling finals, job interviews, and going to the hospital to see my mom. My aunt (55F, mom's sister) flew in from Florida because the situation was pretty bad (again, brink of death. Pneumonia is no joke). My aunt stayed here for a week and during that week we found out about my mom's expenses. My mom didn't make much from her work that she had lost (15/hr), and she was paying 1200+ in rent and 800 in the car payments monthly. Keep in mind, this is not including all the other crazy spending and other necessary expenses she had. We obviously had a long talk with my mom and had her give up her Mercedes Benz to the dealership. My mom and aunt made a plan that my mom would stay with my aunt in Florida until she could get back on her feet. My mom was hospitalized for a few more weeks and I stayed at her place after she got released to help her around. My mom ended up moving cross country to Florida that July.Fast forward to now, my mom has been living in Florida with my aunt for several months and my aunt has been more than helpful. She's living with my aunt for free and has been covering all of her current medical expenses such as prescriptions and doctor visits. My aunt is also covering my mom's lawyer fees and traveling expenses as my mom keeps having to go to court with her ex-husband (and to do that she needs to fly back here). My aunt has been more than helpful and she really doesn't need to do all that she's been doing. However, my aunt had called me one day a couple months back to tell me that my mom and her had been arguing a lot since she has been down there. It's really taking toll on my aunt and it's not fair to her. Apparently, their arguments can get really nasty that it's toxic for both of them. My aunt told me that they constantly argue and that my mom has said some pretty nasty stuff towards her. My aunt doesn't need to deal with that toxicity, so I told her to do what she thinks is right. Yet, nothing came of it, so I assumed they had made up.Yesterday, I called my mom to see what's up. She was discussing how she didn't like Florida and how she doesn't want to be there anymore. I obviously asked her why and if everything was okay, yet she refused to tell me anything. Though she claims that she misses me, as an excuse. She then starts saying that she wants to move back and move in with me. Right then and there, I just replied with a big ""NO"". She replied with something along the lines of ""well, i'm sick, so you need to take care of me.""

As a 22-year-old male, who recently graduated college and now living life on my own terms, I don't want to be responsible for another human being. I'm really early in my career, only making 42k annually and having plans on going to grad school part-time this coming Fall for a Master's. If my mom lives with me, I don't see how I would support her without there being any stress. I'm just now learning how to be financially independent and I feel as if I would be putting a hold on my life to take care of my mother. I enjoy my personal freedom and I don't want to give that up, it would just seem unfair to me. On the other hand, if my aunt kicks her out then my mom has absolutely nowhere else to go.

We have basically grown up together, we graduated high school together, went to college together. When we went to high school, we both got accepted at a large state school, our friend got accepted at a smaller state school close by.We are all in our fourth year of college now and graduating soon. I accepted an internship in a city 3 hours away to get money and experience and credit. While gone, my SO and our friend began hanging out more. I initially didn't mind. We had been friends for so long that I completely trusted him and he wasn't with her that often. We had gone camping together, gone on vacations together, hung out and gotten high with just the three of us. Just me and him would hang out, and just him and my SO would hang out. We had all been friends for so long that I trusted him and my SO.Bad move.My SO told me that the two of them and another friend were going to spend a weekend at a near-by big city with a fun nightlife.Today, I learned that he got a room in a $500/night hotel and it was just the two of them. They fucked that night.Now, she swears up and down that she felt doesn't want to be with him, and they only had sex because I've been away. She feels terrible and hasn't eaten or slept in days.Obviously, I should break up with her but I've never been alone since I was 15. I still love her, but I feel cheated and heartbroken and disrespected and hurt and all these things that I'm not used to feeling. I don't know what to do. If/when we break up I'll have wasted 7 years of my life and I'll be absolutely alone in a brand new city until my internship is over.There are more details but I don't think they're that important.Also don't give me the usual reddit answer of ""all girls are the same"" and whatever. I'm trying super hard to not be bitter and I don't wanna hear any gross generalizations.---**tl;dr**: GF of 7 cheated on me with a friend of ours while I was away on an internship. I still love her. I don't know what to do.","There's no easy answer here. It sounds like you're really struggling with what to do. On the one hand, you obviously want to break up with your girlfriend if she cheated on you.

Worker discretion is advised.),"Your task is to choose which, of two, advice is better, then justify your decision.","text, nlp, advice",Relationship,I [23F] have a question for men in monogamous relationships.,"I’ve been dating my boyfriend [25M] for 3.5 years now. For about 2.5 years, we were long distance since I was in college in a different state. Now that I’m home, we’ve been adjusting to a new stage of our relationship. It’s been rough, but we’re good communicators and have a strong relationship.One thing that I struggle with in most aspects of my life is feeling insecure. This is something I’ve been trying really hard to work on, because I noticed that it’s had some negative impact on our relationship, and my overall self esteem.When my boyfriend and I were going through a tough time over the summer, he had made a comment about how he’s in his 20s, living on his own in a bar-town and that sometimes he has the passing thought that he’s “missing out” because he’s in a relationship. This really hurt me, and has stuck with me since then.I brought it up yesterday, and he had said that this is a thought that almost every guy in a relationship has. He told me that if a hot girl comes up to him at the bar, he doesn’t just shut her down and will talk to her for a bit. Of course, this made me upset due to my insecurities, but he emphasized that the important part is that he knows he loves me and wouldn’t want to do anything with these “hot girls.”So, my question is, is this really a thought that a lot of guys in relationships have? I know that I’m probably over-thinking it and making a mountain out of a mole hill, but I just would like to know what some of your thoughts are. Thanks!","Plenty of people think those things. Most of us are smart enough not to say them to our SO, though. I don’t blame you for being uncomfortable with that, and you might mention to him that it worsens your issue with insecurity when he says those things.I also have some major insecurities. I’d be having a serious talk with my girlfriend if she talked about missing out because of random dudes she meets. The entire concept of having a monogamous partner is that you don’t have to worry about shit like this. It’s a terrible thing to do to someone who has more than enough worries already.","There's no doubt that feeling insecure can put a strain on any relationship. However, it's important to remember that everyone experiences moments of insecurity from time to time. The key is to communicate openly with your partner about how you're feeling.From what you've said, it sounds like your boyfriend is being honest with you about his thoughts and feelings. It's important to remember that just because he has these thoughts, it doesn't mean that he's going to act on them. He loves you and is committed to your relationship, so try not to let your insecurities get the best of you.If you're finding it difficult to shake off your feelings of insecurity, it might be worth seeking out professional help. A therapist can help you work through your issues and learn how to better deal with your insecurities.",2b,helpful,meaning

For about 2.5 years, we were long distance since I was in college in a different state. Now that I’m home, we’ve been adjusting to a new stage of our relationship. It’s been rough, but we’re good communicators and have a strong relationship.One thing that I struggle with in most aspects of my life is feeling insecure. This is something I’ve been trying really hard to work on, because I noticed that it’s had some negative impact on our relationship, and my overall self esteem.When my boyfriend and I were going through a tough time over the summer, he had made a comment about how he’s in his 20s, living on his own in a bar-town and that sometimes he has the passing thought that he’s “missing out” because he’s in a relationship. This really hurt me, and has stuck with me since then.I brought it up yesterday, and he had said that this is a thought that almost every guy in a relationship has. He told me that if a hot girl comes up to him at the bar, he doesn’t just shut her down and will talk to her for a bit. Of course, this made me upset due to my insecurities, but he emphasized that the important part is that he knows he loves me and wouldn’t want to do anything with these “hot girls.”So, my question is, is this really a thought that a lot of guys in relationships have? I know that I’m probably over-thinking it and making a mountain out of a mole hill, but I just would like to know what some of your thoughts are. Thanks!","Plenty of people think those things. Most of us are smart enough not to say them to our SO, though. I don’t blame you for being uncomfortable with that, and you might mention to him that it worsens your issue with insecurity when he says those things.I also have some major insecurities. I’d be having a serious talk with my girlfriend if she talked about missing out because of random dudes she meets. The entire concept of having a monogamous partner is that you don’t have to worry about shit like this. It’s a terrible thing to do to someone who has more than enough worries already.","There's no doubt that feeling insecure can put a strain on any relationship. However, it's important to remember that everyone experiences moments of insecurity from time to time. The key is to communicate openly with your partner about how you're feeling.From what you've said, it sounds like your boyfriend is being honest with you about his thoughts and feelings. It's important to remember that just because he has these thoughts, it doesn't mean that he's going to act on them. He loves you and is committed to your relationship, so try not to let your insecurities get the best of you.If you're finding it difficult to shake off your feelings of insecurity, it might be worth seeking out professional help.

I've done this kind of work before in the past and initially said yes. He's also hiring a few other women to help too. I'm starting to have second thoughts but he's insistent that this is my birthday present to him and that it's not a big deal. We've been dating for about five or six months now, so I'm just feeling too much pressure for the amount of time we've been together.The birthday party is at his house in his backyard. There's plenty of privacy and this time of year it will be a warm night almost certainly. My second thoughts are coming from meeting some of his friends for the first time.","You know its wrong or you wouldn’t even be here, explain to him that you made a mistake to agree and that his request is unacceptable...his reaction will show what he really thinks of you...sorry to be the one saying this, but Im pretty sure the guy is just playing and using you.","There's no right or wrong answer here, it's all about what you're comfortable with. If you're not comfortable with the idea ofwaitressing topless, then you shouldn't do it. You should always be comfortable with anything sexual that you do, and if you're not, then you shouldn't do it. Talk to your boyfriend about your concerns and see if he's willing to compromise in some way. Perhaps you can waitress in a bikini top instead of being topless, or maybe you can help with the party in some other way.

I'm unsure why, but I'm assuming she's doing it to get away from the investigation or something, I'm not aware that she has anyone up there to stay with and I doubt she could just stay there, so I dont know what her plan really is.Anyhow, since she's being investigated, I'm assuming she can't leave the country. Should I tell the police she said she was going to? Or if she tries to will she be stopped anyway? What should I do here?","If your ex is being investigated by CPS, it is important to take action to protect your child. You should contact the police and let them know about your ex's plans to leave the country. If she tries to leave, she may be stopped by authorities. It is important to stay involved in the investigation and take steps to ensure your child's safety.",No it's not legal. Contact CPS and inform them. Contact your lawyer as well. AFAIK she won't be able to cross the border without written consent from you. This is a case for your lawyer to pursue.,1b,helpful,meaning

I miss her so much, but my dad couldn’t care less. He’s happy that she’s gone and that he’s free.Ever since my mom got sick, we’ve been struggling financially. My mom was a well paid nurse, my dad teaches high school English. She obviously earned more than him.

I wanted to go through it with him and reminisce, but he was just looking for things to sell, like her jewelry and purses and clothes. I told him not to sell them, that I want to keep them, but he said that he needs the money.

I live in their house,"Using a throwaway because I post a lot on other subreddits and this is a weird post lol. I posted this on AITA and people seem to think it's fair for me to ask, but I want to do it respectfully and politely so I'm asking for advice here.Basically I (16M) recently moved in with my brother (24M) and his husband (26M). They got married about three months ago and just got their first place together. Before that they lived in the family house along with my dad (45M) my sister (18F) my brother (19M) and it was pretty crowded, I had to share a room with my middle brother and we were always on top of everyone all the time. We've never had that much money which is why my brother lived there with us and his now husband, to contribute to the bills and stuff.Pretty much straight after my brother got married his husband kind of fell into a really well paid job (he didn't even apply for it, just got offered it and obviously took it) and they had actual money for the first time in their life, so my brother and his husband decided to get their own place and give my dad money every month for the family household bills.They asked if I wanted to move out with them to a nicer part of town into a bigger house where the schools are better and I agreed because it was a generous offer, I really appreciate that they still thought of me even though they were finally getting their own house. My brother and I are pretty close and I'm genuinely thankful for the offer.So far it's been really good, my school is much better and my grades are up, the house and area are really nice, except for one problem- my brother and his husband are really really loud in bed.

He seemed annoyed by what he thought was people “hanging out in his yard” but was really just some people having a conversation on the public sidewalk in front of his house. We genuinely just want everyone to be safe and happy and not mine their property. That is illegal right?Would the police even care?","The best course of action would be to try and talk to the neighbor again, and see if there is any way to come to a compromise that would work for both parties. If the neighbor is not open to any kind of negotiation, then the next best step would be to contact the police and see if they can do anything to help resolve the situation.",>He did put some nail in the ground sticking upwards near his mail box which is very close to the sidewalk the kids use.This is illegal.Installing anything on your property that could harm people is illegal and if he actually does it you should call the police.,2a,helpful,writing

Thank you advisors!,"I finally had my last day outAs you can see through my history, I’m sixteen years girl and i was given a month a few weeks ago because of cancer.Today was my last day out.I was in the hospital for a long time, so I didn't know what was out there to lose my sense of the weather. So I wanted to spend my day as an ordinary person today.So, i wore a wig, got up from a wheelchair (relied on a cane) and used public transportation..0.It was hard to bear the pain for up to two hours. But the smell of fresh air made me feel good. (In fact, the chemical smell of the mask was mixed, so it was not completely refreshing air. lol)When I arrived, my boyfriend who met me after nearly 50 days welcomed me. An indescribable feeling was overwhelming. Hehe1.First of all, we went to his home. We decided to watch a movie yesterday, but we went to his house first because we had a lot of time to go to the movie. And spent time with his cat. How cute! I literally wanted to upload the pictures but i realised that there’s no function to upload pictures in this subreddit. kk I'll upload 'em r/cats i guess and you guys should see this.2.Thanks to his mother, the way to the cinema was smooth.And e finally watched a movie. But the problem started here. There was a tremendous pain because the tube injected with painkillers was slightly pressed... the fk. The pain prevented me from focusing on the movie at all. There was more terrible pain than the pain I felt when I pulled out my nail without anesthesia. I vomit enough blood to soak several tissues, but the pain did not stop. My boyfriend patted me by the side and helped me well, and later on, I could concentrate on the movie. Nevertheless, I'm still not sure what the movie is about. lol.3.After the movie, we strolled around the park to reach his house. We talked about stories: such as the lack of future together, the fear of death, the pain of illness, the longing of everyday life. And we did what ordinary couples could do, such as holding each other's hands or folding their arms or hug...(it's pretty shy to say myself lol) Like an ""ordinary"" person. It was a pity that I lacked one hand because of the cane..4.Back to his house, we played with the cat and left a video to last out memories with an expectation that someone would watch this video and miss me. And we exchanged letters with each other's symbols and just cried. a lot. I still don't want to die, but an uplifting feeling-the fear of dying soon, the need to leave my loved ones, and the sadness of the person in front of me etc-overlapped with tears. And we promised to see each other next life..5.We left his house because of the time limit back to the hospital. And i also said goodbye his cat. i'll miss her so much. And my boyfriend kindly guided me close to the hospital! how kind of him <3 It's too sad to leave such a good person. Where we broke up, we cried a lot again. It's really the last now. It's really over. Such thoughts..6.So, I'm a hospital again. As always, I am now in a hospital uniform with the hospital meal. But it still feels like his cat's hair is on my clothes and he's hugging me. The futon seems to smell his. I will miss today so much. maybe i'll be happy thinking about this day until I die. hehe.7.And sadly, because of the age or health conditions or etc, there’s so lottttssssss of advice I couldn’t make it real. I’m so sorry about that. Even just walking was hard things for me! But thank you xoxo have a lovely day!","1. First and foremost, make sure to get plenty of rest and pain medication to help you get through the day.2. Take your time and don't try to do too much. It's okay to take breaks and just enjoy each other's company.3. Be prepared for some pain, but try to focus on the good moments and the time you have together.4. Make sure to exchange letters or videos so you can remember each other after you're gone.5. And lastly, try to focus on the positive and enjoy the time you have together.","Do not go gentle into that good night,Old age should burn and rave at close of day;Rage, rage against the dying of the light.Though wise men at their end know dark is right,Because their words had forked no lightning theyDo not go gentle into that good night.Good men, the last wave by, crying how brightTheir frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,Rage, rage against the dying of the light.",1a,nothelpful,contradiction

Thank you advisors!,"I finally had my last day outAs you can see through my history, I’m sixteen years girl and i was given a month a few weeks ago because of cancer.Today was my last day out.I was in the hospital for a long time, so I didn't know what was out there to lose my sense of the weather. So I wanted to spend my day as an ordinary person today.So, i wore a wig, got up from a wheelchair (relied on a cane) and used public transportation..0.It was hard to bear the pain for up to two hours. But the smell of fresh air made me feel good. (In fact, the chemical smell of the mask was mixed, so it was not completely refreshing air. lol)When I arrived, my boyfriend who met me after nearly 50 days welcomed me. An indescribable feeling was overwhelming. Hehe1.First of all, we went to his home. We decided to watch a movie yesterday, but we went to his house first because we had a lot of time to go to the movie. And spent time with his cat. How cute! I literally wanted to upload the pictures but i realised that there’s no function to upload pictures in this subreddit. kk I'll upload 'em r/cats i guess and you guys should see this.2.Thanks to his mother, the way to the cinema was smooth.And e finally watched a movie. But the problem started here. There was a tremendous pain because the tube injected with painkillers was slightly pressed... the fk. The pain prevented me from focusing on the movie at all. There was more terrible pain than the pain I felt when I pulled out my nail without anesthesia. I vomit enough blood to soak several tissues, but the pain did not stop. My boyfriend patted me by the side and helped me well, and later on, I could concentrate on the movie. Nevertheless, I'm still not sure what the movie is about. lol.3.After the movie, we strolled around the park to reach his house. We talked about stories: such as the lack of future together, the fear of death, the pain of illness, the longing of everyday life. And we did what ordinary couples could do, such as holding each other's hands or folding their arms or hug...(it's pretty shy to say myself lol) Like an ""ordinary"" person. It was a pity that I lacked one hand because of the cane..4.Back to his house, we played with the cat and left a video to last out memories with an expectation that someone would watch this video and miss me. And we exchanged letters with each other's symbols and just cried. a lot. I still don't want to die, but an uplifting feeling-the fear of dying soon, the need to leave my loved ones, and the sadness of the person in front of me etc-overlapped with tears. And we promised to see each other next life..5.We left his house because of the time limit back to the hospital. And i also said goodbye his cat. i'll miss her so much. And my boyfriend kindly guided me close to the hospital! how kind of him <3 It's too sad to leave such a good person. Where we broke up, we cried a lot again. It's really the last now. It's really over. Such thoughts..6.So, I'm a hospital again. As always, I am now in a hospital uniform with the hospital meal. But it still feels like his cat's hair is on my clothes and he's hugging me. The futon seems to smell his. I will miss today so much. maybe i'll be happy thinking about this day until I die. hehe.7.And sadly, because of the age or health conditions or etc, there’s so lottttssssss of advice I couldn’t make it real. I’m so sorry about that. Even just walking was hard things for me! But thank you xoxo have a lovely day!","1.

Judging Quality of Advice (WARNING: This HIT may contain adult content. Worker discretion is advised.),"Your task is to choose which, of two, advice is better, then justify your decision.","text, nlp, advice",Relationship,I (19M) broke up with my (18M) boyfriend and then left for College. Now none of my friends will talk to me,"Long one, sorry.When I (19M) was at high school, I had a really tight knit group of friends. There were maybe ten of us, plus some others who hung around sometimes, and we used to have a lot of house parties and spend a lot of time with each other. Most of us didn't really have any other friends, but we mostly got on really well as a group and I enjoyed spending time with all of them.One of the guys in the group (B, 18M), I clicked with immediately when I met him (when we were around 16). I immediately had a bit of a crush on him, and by all reports he liked me back. However, I was still figuring myself out, and didn't realise I was gay yet, and I pretty soon after got into a long term relationship with a girl. B also got into a relationship around the same time, with another guy. Both of these relationships lasted 1.5-2 years. My relationship was absolutely terrible, as I was a closeted gay man in a relationship with a woman, and she actually has since realised she's a lesbian (honestly that relationship could be a whole other post but I won't go into it too much). Suffice to say I had a lot of regrets about that. Just after I broke up with my girlfriend, B also broke up with his boyfriend, for unrelated reasons.We immediately turned to each other in the aftermath of the breakups, as we both felt we were going through a similar thing. We'd still remained friends throughout these couple of years, but we got much closer, and spent a lot of time together one on one. Not officially dates, but could probably be interpreted as dates by an outside perspective. After a couple of months, I asked B out properly, and we started to consider ourselves boyfriends. Another couple of months later, and we temporarily moved in together (I know that's way too soon to move in with someone, it was just temporary over the summer as he had been kicked out of his house and I was about to move away for college anyway, so I thought there was no harm in us living together for a month or so). During this time, I had a lot of mental health problems, and I was very stressed due to my job, and I recognise I probably didn't treat him as well as I should have (distant and moody, didn't really want to have sex much, irritable).After our time living together was up, and he'd found somewhere more permanent to live, I sat him down and broke up with him. B was a really nice guy, but I felt that we'd gotten together too soon after I'd gotten out of a bad relationship, and I wasn't really in a place to be dating someone at that time. I felt like I'd treated him quite badly, and he deserved better than that. I was also about to move a few hours away for college and I didn't feel like I could keep up a long distance relationship (and maybe selfishly I wanted to use college as an opportunity to experiment and maybe sleep around a little bit).

Now none of my friends will talk to me,"Long one, sorry.When I (19M) was at high school, I had a really tight knit group of friends. There were maybe ten of us, plus some others who hung around sometimes, and we used to have a lot of house parties and spend a lot of time with each other. Most of us didn't really have any other friends, but we mostly got on really well as a group and I enjoyed spending time with all of them.One of the guys in the group (B, 18M), I clicked with immediately when I met him (when we were around 16). I immediately had a bit of a crush on him, and by all reports he liked me back. However, I was still figuring myself out, and didn't realise I was gay yet, and I pretty soon after got into a long term relationship with a girl. B also got into a relationship around the same time, with another guy. Both of these relationships lasted 1.5-2 years. My relationship was absolutely terrible, as I was a closeted gay man in a relationship with a woman, and she actually has since realised she's a lesbian (honestly that relationship could be a whole other post but I won't go into it too much). Suffice to say I had a lot of regrets about that. Just after I broke up with my girlfriend, B also broke up with his boyfriend, for unrelated reasons.We immediately turned to each other in the aftermath of the breakups, as we both felt we were going through a similar thing. We'd still remained friends throughout these couple of years, but we got much closer, and spent a lot of time together one on one.

During this time, I had a lot of mental health problems, and I was very stressed due to my job, and I recognise I probably didn't treat him as well as I should have (distant and moody, didn't really want to have sex much, irritable).After our time living together was up, and he'd found somewhere more permanent to live, I sat him down and broke up with him. B was a really nice guy, but I felt that we'd gotten together too soon after I'd gotten out of a bad relationship, and I wasn't really in a place to be dating someone at that time. I felt like I'd treated him quite badly, and he deserved better than that.

I have 4 kids whom I consider myself pretty close with. My partner has a 16-year-old daughter and their relationship makes me uncomfortable. I’ve talked to her about it numerous times and she always becomes very defensive.When I first started dating my partner, her daughter (15 at the time) slept with her mom every night. I put my foot down on that one right away. I asked my partner for our bed to be only our bed as I would often spend nights at her house. Then, it turned into the daughter going in there and “cuddling” with her mom when I wasn’t there. When I say cuddling, I mean that the daughter will spoon her mother and lightly scratch her all over, including areas that I consider private (breasts, butt, lower tummy) The daughter will reach under the shirt and into the underwear to do this. As far as I know the vagina has never been touched, but she goes low enough to feel pubic hair. I tried to explain that the thought of being intimate with my partner in a bed that she shared with her daughter creeped me out. I now live with my partner. There have been several times that the daughter has come into our room and tried to snuggle both of us. She strokes my arms and will try to spoon me as well (she does NOT go under my clothes!) She has touched my breasts over my clothes while lightly scratching and I find it uncomfortable. I try to make a joke out of it “ahhh, you just touched my boob!” My partner will often hold her daughters hand while sitting on the couch, in the car or in a restaurant. It’s more than just the cuddling and hand holding, it’s this longing look she gets in her eyes while she does it that makes me uncomfortable, too. It’s like she is in love with her mother. I have spoken with my partner about this and how she needs to start setting boundaries with her daughter. My partner always becomes defensive and then tries to tell me that I’m just jealous of their relationship. But for the most part, once she calms down she cools it for a while.Well, yesterday it came to a head. My partner was taking a bath in our jet tub (no curtain) and I walk in to our bedroom after about 15 minutes and her 16 year old daughter is sitting on the toilet lid talking to her mother. She’s just sitting there looking directly at her mom (almost ogling) as my partner is bathing, which I consider to be a private thing. I made a comment about “ok, I’ll just leave you two alone” and then left the room. The daughter continued to stay in there while her mom bathed for another 10-15 minutes. I came back into the room as my partner was exiting the tub and her daughter then left the room.I told her again that it makes me very uncomfortable that she has no boundaries with her daughter. My partner immediately becomes defensive and a fight ensues. I ended up telling my partner that it makes me feel so uncomfortable that I don’t want her to even touch me. I told her that it actually makes me feel yucky. She accuses me of being jealous (I did say I felt like they had a more intimate relationship at times than we do.)As a backstory, my partner raised her daughter essentially without a dad and with the help of her mother. She always says that “it was just me and her for almost 15 years”My question is, am I overreacting? Is this normal behavior to have between a 16-year-old and her mother?Tl;dr: my partner is extremely close with her 16-year-old daughter.

I was really happy he wanted to mark the occasion and agreed gratefully right away. The earliest date we could find was today, and my father booked a restaurant in the city where my adult siblings including my twin live. He, my step-mum, and young half sister live fairly close. My husband and I live about 100 miles from this city, usually an easy train journey of 90 minutes or less.Today though, we had really bad weather that shut down all public transport from my town to the city. Neither my husband nor I wanted to take the risk of driving that distance in those conditions, so regretfully I called my dad to say we wouldn’t be making it. I was hoping that he would offer to reschedule it, seeing as it was in part my birthday lunch. However he did not. I texted my adult siblings to say we wouldn’t be able to make it, and they said that was a shame and we’d be missed.I had a huge emotional reaction to this and cried all day on my husband’s shoulder. I’m struggling to understand this. My role in the family is one of those who remembers everybody’s birthdays and reminds my siblings, organises family gifts and celebrations, arranges get togethers so we see each other regularly (my mum also does a lot of this and I learned it from her). I am really sensitive and conscientious about this and genuinely enjoy doing it. But now I feel angry and upset that I put effort into coordinating ways to bring us together and make memories, and it feels like nobody thought it would be important that I be there for my own birthday. I probably sound like a spoiled brat as it was also my twin’s birthday who was able to attend, but I wish somebody had at least offered to reschedule it so I could be present- it’s what I would have done.From this, I’ve learned that I need to evaluate the effort I put in, with a view to doing less and allow others to step up more, and also work on communicating my feelings and needs in the moment. But I don’t know if or how I should bring up my feelings with my dad and siblings. It’s upset me so much that I feel my choices are either to avoid talking to them for a while until my hurt feelings are soothed, or to bring it up with them individually. What should I do?

For example, you could explain that you understand it wasn't possible for them to reschedule the lunch at short notice, but that you wish they had at least offered. Alternatively, you could simply express your hurt feelings and tell them how much you would have enjoyed being able to celebrate your birthday with them. Whatever you do, try to avoid sounding accusatory or angry.It's also important to remember that you can't control how other people react, so even if you do talk to your family about your feelings, they may not respond the way you want them to. In that case, the best thing you can do is focus on taking care of yourself and giving yourself the love and attention you deserve.","I don't think they should have cancelled and rescheduled it, but they should've offered to have a dinner for you at a later date. I understand how upsetting this would be and how left out and underappreciated you feel, but at the same time it would've been upsetting to your twin had they cancelled the whole thing because you couldn't make it.

I was really happy he wanted to mark the occasion and agreed gratefully right away. The earliest date we could find was today, and my father booked a restaurant in the city where my adult siblings including my twin live. He, my step-mum, and young half sister live fairly close. My husband and I live about 100 miles from this city, usually an easy train journey of 90 minutes or less.Today though, we had really bad weather that shut down all public transport from my town to the city. Neither my husband nor I wanted to take the risk of driving that distance in those conditions, so regretfully I called my dad to say we wouldn’t be making it. I was hoping that he would offer to reschedule it, seeing as it was in part my birthday lunch. However he did not. I texted my adult siblings to say we wouldn’t be able to make it, and they said that was a shame and we’d be missed.I had a huge emotional reaction to this and cried all day on my husband’s shoulder. I’m struggling to understand this. My role in the family is one of those who remembers everybody’s birthdays and reminds my siblings, organises family gifts and celebrations, arranges get togethers so we see each other regularly (my mum also does a lot of this and I learned it from her). I am really sensitive and conscientious about this and genuinely enjoy doing it. But now I feel angry and upset that I put effort into coordinating ways to bring us together and make memories, and it feels like nobody thought it would be important that I be there for my own birthday. I probably sound like a spoiled brat as it was also my twin’s birthday who was able to attend, but I wish somebody had at least offered to reschedule it so I could be present- it’s what I would have done.From this, I’ve learned that I need to evaluate the effort I put in, with a view to doing less and allow others to step up more, and also work on communicating my feelings and needs in the moment. But I don’t know if or how I should bring up my feelings with my dad and siblings. It’s upset me so much that I feel my choices are either to avoid talking to them for a while until my hurt feelings are soothed, or to bring it up with them individually. What should I do? And if I decide to talk to any of them, what should I say?TL;DR Due to unavoidable circumstances, I couldn’t attend mine and my twin’s long-planned birthday lunch at short notice. The rest of my family went without me and I wish they hadn’t. Aside from working on myself, what should I do now- talk to them about it or not?","If you decide to talk to your family about your feelings, try to do so in a constructive and positive way.

Talk to them about what you're feeling and let them help you through this tough time.It's also important to give yourself time to grieve. This is a big loss, and it's going to take some time to process. Don't be afraid to cry, to be angry, or to feel any other emotion. It's all part of the process.Finally, try to find some closure if you can. If there is any information about the murder, try to find out as much as you can. This can help you to start to accept what happened and to begin to move on.","You grieve as if for a loved one, because you loved him once. It doesn’t mean you’re unfaithful to your husband. In fact, you should speak to your husband about your feelings when you feel this pain.The death of someone who was a part of your life is a harrowing experience, regardless of when it occurs or how close you were to the person when it happened.I’m very sorry for your ex-boyfriend’s murder, and I hope the person responsible is brought to swift justice. I also hope you and your husband, along with your ex’s family, find some peace in the coming days.",2b,helpful,writing

We were together for three years, and while things weren't always great, he was a really good guy. He had some issues which greatly contributed to our breakup. We remained on friendly terms after we split up, and he eventually overcame his issues. Sounded like he was getting his life back on track, which I was very happy to hear.I met my now husband pretty shortly after the breakup, and we've been married for almost four years now. We ran into my ex and his mom (who I was very close to while we were dating) just a few months ago. I introduced everybody, but it was definitely awkward, as would be expected.But yeah. There was a high profile crime in my area, and I was reading an article and saw my ex's name. It's a common name so I wasn't worried, but I messaged him just to check. Didn't hear anything. Read another article that included his middle name, age, and where he lived. It all matched. Went on his sister's Facebook, and all I saw were condolences.It was him.I broke. Left work early, called my husband, called my parents. This just hits so hard. It feels weird hurting this much over an ex, and it's not like I'm not over him. Luckily my husband understands and said even he's sad, that the whole situation just sucks. It was, from what I've been able to find out, brutal and awful. I don't know how to handle this, and I feel uncomfortable talking about it too much with my husband.Has anybody been through anything like this?

The title explains most of it. My FiL had a life insurance policy for my husband. When my husband's father passed, my husband got this LI policy transferred to his name. They send letters saying that they're taking payment out of the policy to cover the monthly payment. My husband has tried and given up on contacting them, because the guy avoids and doesn't return calls or emails. My husband even tried a ruse of opening another account for our kids to get him to respond. Nothing. This account is being slowly drained and I don't want that to happen. I'm now a beneficiary of my husband's account, but not on the account, so I can't try to contact them and get anywhere, only my husband can.TYIA.","What company? You do not need to work with an agent to “surrender” a policy. In most every company, you can request the surrender form and they will send it to you. Most carriers will also accept a fax submission or even email of a scanned/signed form to close the policy.The policy (assuming its a VUL or UL), will continue pulling the cost of insurance from the cash value while it’s in force.

I have two older brothers, one is 20 (he stays in an apartment connected to our house) and the middle guy just went 17. We all live at home full time, no relationship with our dad. We all really like our stepdad though, he's great!My stepdad has a son, Andy, who is 9. They are moving in this weekend. Andy mom passed away when he was a baby, so Andy also stays with his dad full time. That means he'll be here at the house full time.

I realize Andy is going from being an only child, to having three stepbros living with him, and that's a lot to take in. In addition to a new house, new neighbors, new room, and a stepmom. Also is there anything I should know about now being a older stepbrother to Andy? I've always been the youngest (and my brothers always joke that you can tell), but I want to be a good brother to Andy.Andy's quieter than me and my brothers, plus the fact that we're bigger and he's going to be in new surroundings, im worried that if he doesn't like something he won't speak up about it.I guess my question really is, i have a new brother moving in, how do i foster the best relationship possible with him?any advice is welcome!","Make sure there’s room in the house for his toys and belongings. Ask him to go kick around a soccer ball with you and your brother, or see if he wants to watch a movie with you. Offer to show him around the house when he first gets there. Ask him questions about himself, what games he likes or what his favorite class is in school. When everyone’s at home chilling, just pop your head into the room and say “hey what’s up?”.

I've recently gone into therapy for some unrelated issues, and when I mentioned what makes me feel uncomfortable about my parents my therapist said that they're definitely a bit too overprotective. I still would like to know if their behavior is really more extreme than what it should be at my age, from more people that are unbiased. I'll name a few things that stick out to me the most. For some background, I'm a 19 year old in my second semester in community college. I'm hoping to live on my own next semester when I transfer to a 4 year university.1). What bothers me the most is them trying to prevent me from dating someone I really like. My dad found out something about my boyfriend that he really doesn't like, and forbade me from seeing him. He said that he's going to get someone to intervene and talk me out of it. He also told me not to get into a serious relationship with him. My boyfriend and I are currently long distance because he's in the army (getting out in a few months).I told my therapist about the situation, and she agreed that them trying to forbid me from seeing him is too far.","When I was 18, I went off to college.

I felt uneasy about this as it felt like spying but I did it anyway.What I stumbled across made me sick to my stomach.She had been round a mutual friends house for a bbq on the Saturday night and when she got home she made a drunken phone call to another mutual friend (we will call him douche bag)The phone call goes something like this from her end “Hi where did you go? Oh ok just wondered where you’d gone. Did you have fun tonight? Good me too. I’m glad we can be friends again after what happened between us last year. Yeah I’d like to too but if Matt finds out I’d be fucked and he’s probably kill you. Blah blah blah ok bye”So naturally after hearing this I confronted my wife and she denied it all and just said what happened a year ago was they’d both had a drinker chat and said they’d probably get together if I wasn’t around (ouch) this was obviously hurtful to hear but not grounds to leave a marriage for.Since then (it’s been about 6 months) I am 99% sure something happened between them and i feel like a prick for just letting them both get away with it but I can’t just leave her without proof.

I think she still just wants to be friends, but now they have me worried about this, because I don't want to lead her on or hurt her. I've never been friends with many women, I really enjoy her company, and I wouldn't want to jeopardize our friendship.For further background, and I think this is relevant, on the ladder of attractiveness, she's a top rung and I'm one of the safe steps below the middle. Yes, you read that right, and yes, in my heart, I just want to be friends (let the gender stereotypes begin!). Also, we both recently got on dating apps and have talked about it, and neither of us have any kids.So, should I believe that we're still both on the same page?  I'm hesitant to bring it up, because then it seems paranoid or weird. Are there signs I should look for to indicate that her feelings have changed?  Or are my guy friends just reading way too much into this?TL;DR: going on a platonic Valentine's Day dinner with another recently divorced friend. I am just interested in friendship, but my friends think she may be thinking about more. Advice?","Who cares what your friends think? You and she already discussed clearly that neither of you are looking for a relationship, and specifically said this isn’t a date.Get out of your head. It’s just dinner.","If you're not interested in pursuing a romantic relationship with this person, it's probably best to avoid any sort of date-like activity on Valentine's Day. While it's possible that she may be interested in more than just friendship, it's also possible that she's just trying to be nice and make the best of a difficult day. If you're not sure what her intentions are, it's best to err on the side of caution and avoid anything that could be misinterpreted as romantic interest.",2b,nothelpful,neutral

And now that I am moving on from that into another field she is too!Now they also got engaged just months before us(only because BIL knew my husband was going to and had to beat us to it) and married 6 months before us.I have not gotten to have a life moment without having to share it with her or be followed.Now she has always said she never wanted another kid but all of a sudden, when we share that we plan to start trying for baby #1 this year, they are trying for baby #2 this year.How do I handle this? I just want to have a life moment for myself without having to share.","If you feel like your sister-in-law is always copying you, it's important to communicate with her directly about your feelings. It's possible that she is unaware of how her behavior is affecting you, and a honest conversation could help to improve the situation. If you find that your attempts to talk to her are unsuccessful, it may be best to distance yourself from her and create your own independent life.","If you don't want her to copy you then stop sharing this kind of information with her. Once you stop she can't follow.This may sound crazy, but does Brandy look up to you as some sort of role model.",2a,helpful,meaning

It basically was 2 years of bottled frustration coming to a head. She eventually ended up finding new employment at two different places, both in the same field. Back when she was still employed at the original place she had quit in december, her boss had asked her to sign a noncompete agreement, and she had refused to (this was months prior to the quitting and had nothing to do with her leaving.) Over the course of this weekend, both of the places she found employment at fired her out of the blue. The one place had a hard time coming up with a reason as to why they were terminating her, giving excuses from ""you're too high energy"" to saying it was about her going to her car twice to grab a pad. I didnt think much of it at the time, as I figured maybe her boss just didnt like her, as her performance didnt seem to be the issue. This firing came a day after the boss who fired her had told her she was going to make her a key to the store so she could come in early to handle some paperwork the day prior to the termination. The following day, her second place of employment did the same thing, this time not even being able to give her a reason, telling her shes great at what she does and they are really sorry, but they have to let her go. At some point, she did overhear her boss talking to another employee saying ""I dont want to, but my lawyers are directing me to do it.""To me, this seems that her boss from the job she had left in december is pulling some shady stuff and contacting her employeers telling them that they have a noncompete with her, when in fact they dont.

So long story short I’ve been hanging out with my ex because I’m working through some shit in life and he’s been a really good friend. he was my first real relationship (post college) and we were together for about a year and a half before I found out he cheated on me with a random girl a few times and he was still sending provocative texts with his ex’s. Kinda all happened on the same weekend and I flipped and blew up. His family members defended him saying that since we weren’t “officially labeled gf/bf” (we said we were gonna be exclusive but never talked about labels bc were both just like that). That fueled my fire even more and I began to resent the family for in their own way defending him.Tonight we were going to hang out when he asked that I come and hang out with his family tonight. I rejected but offered to drive him to his parents house as he needed to pick up his car from the house too (idk what happened there). He got all upset but accepted the ride.When we got there I waited for him to get out of the car when he started to argue that since it’s been about two months since I found out I should be over the entire thing. He then proceeded to call me “young” and “inexperienced” and that everyone goes through things like this and I was just making a bigger deal about it. He then asked that I only come in for 30 minutes and leave and I told him I couldn’t keep up the facade even if it was for his family members.I stood my ground and said no and dropped him off. Now I’m back at my place, just upset because I truly don’t think I need to put up with this but I feel like maybe I am overreacting.

One grabbed a sizeable block of ice and hurled it into the side of my car as I passed. I stopped and the boy who threw it was profusely apologizing. I rang the doorbell, mom comes out, and I tell her what happened. She says, boys, ""come inside""! And then, ""which one did it?"" I told her, he admitted that he did it. Then, she closed the door.I live about 3 min away so I drove home and had my neighbor look at my car with me. There are 3 dents where the block of ice hit. I just bought this car certified pre-owned and had only made one payment at this time so I know for a fact that the damage is from the block of ice. I drove back to the house and said hey look, my car is damaged so I'd like to exchange info so I can get this fixed. She said, 1) how can you be sure that it's from them? and 2) a little snow doesn't do that much damage. I explained again that it was a block of ice. She told me to call the police.Police come, he takes it very seriously and lectures both the boys and the parents about how dangerous that is and asks me if I want citations issued for the boys. I say no, I just want my car fixed. He tells them they are lucky that's all I want, agrees to write the police report. The mother gives her side, lies to the police and tells them her kid's friend who is no longer present is the one who threw the ice. It was actually her younger son. I didn't correct her because I was so shocked and confused and the other boy wasn't there at the time. Over the next two days, I go get an estimate for the repair ($1327) and a copy of the police report.

I expect this will land in small claims court because the parents seem positioned to ignore and then say that I can't prove anything, plus they are placing blame on the boys' friend who won't speak to the police. Will the violations actually be enough to draw restitution so I can avoid court?

First, it is possible that your ex-girlfriend may be bluffing and that she does not actually have any intention of filing a police complaint. However, it is also possible that she is serious and that she could follow through on her threat. If you are concerned that she may take legal action, you may want to reach out to an attorney to get advice on how to best protect yourself.Another thing to consider is whether or not you actually have any legal obligation to give your ex-girlfriend money for her clothes. It is possible that she may have a case for trespassing if she can prove that you threw her clothes away without her permission, but it is also possible that a court would find that she abandoned her belongings when she moved out of your home. If you are unsure about your legal obligations, you may want to consult with an attorney to get more information.Ultimately, whether or not you give your ex-girlfriend money for her clothes is up to you.

I agreed to try it, and now it is taking over our relationship [30sF, 40sM]","I want to start by saying that my boyfriend is my favorite person in the world and I adore him.We have been together for 2 years. We've been long-distance for about a year now. I have been planning to relocate to be with him this summer. Right now, we visit each other every three weeks or so.Late last year, my BF asked if he could tell me a secret. He said that he has always been interested in a certain sexual fetish, and never told anyone because he was quite embarrassed. The fetish was female domination, including ""sissy"" play, pegging, humiliation, etc. My BF is a highly educated man with a PhD from one of the top schools in the world. He's the President of a company and works long, stressful hours. He said that he was interested in femdom because it allowed him to be submissive and let go of his responsibilities for a bit.We had a pretty flavorful sex life already, and I consider myself to be quite open-minded, so I told him we could give it a try. I didn't *love* it and it didn't sexually excite me, but it wasn't that bad. Kind of fun, in a non-sexual way, once in a while. He seemed to really love it, so I didn't mind indulging once in a while.He started to get really obsessed with it, and it kind of consumed our long-distance sex life. I asked him to please dial it back a little bit, and he seemed really embarrassed but finally obliged after getting a bit upset with me.However, a few months later, he started to obsess again. It kind of took over our sexting sessions, our Skype sex, etc. I became annoyed and I talked to him about how big a part of our lives this was going to be. I told him that I was concerned about our sexual compatibility because I was fine with this as a once-in-a-while thing but not a lifestyle. He told me that it was just a bedroom thing and we didn't have to do it if I didn't want to.I'll mention that when we are together in person, he is not this obsessive. We do the femdom stuff like once a month, which is fine, because my needs are being met elsewhere. But when we're apart, he is so focused on it and it is really turning me off. HE turns me on, not these characters he plays. I don't like how he changes his appearance. Yesterday, he wanted to do some roleplay long-distance. He told me he had an idea. We have little cameras in our bedrooms so we can ""spy"" on each other. He wanted to pretend that someone had placed a secret camera in his bedroom and caught him doing sissy stuff, and then blackmailed him with it later. I would take screenshots through the camera and send them to him from a fake e-mail at a later time. Sounded fine to me.Except, in his scenario, we were ""us"" and he acted like he invited a ""woman"" over to dominate him behind my back. He acted like someone else was pegging him, like he needed a break to text me and tell me he was watching a movie, like he was making out with and touching another ""woman"", like ""she"" did him up in drag. And when I sent him screenshots as ""blackmail"", he begged me not to tell his girlfriend (me).I feel like my willingness to get into this for him is being taken advantage of. He knows I don't particularly enjoy it, but all his scenarios involve this femdom stuff. And I am SO hurt that he would incorporate cheating on me into this fantasy. I am honestly really devastated.I don't know what to do. He gets very embarrassed when I bring up his fetish in a negative way and I don't know what to say to him. It's going to destroy my attraction to him, and this fake cheating really hurt my feelings.What do I say? What do I do? When we are together, it is not like this, but I am scared to move and end up trapped in a relationship where we are always doing this.**tl;dr** BF told me about an embarrassing fetish a few months ago. I don't care for it but I am fine with indulging once in a while because he likes it so much. However, I feel like he is ignoring my needs in order to focus on this fetish, and our last ""roleplay"" was extremely hurtful for me.","This is something that can happen with kinky people who get to explore a new fetish - their interest in it overtakes their other sexual interests and makes them behave badly.Your bf is behaving badly, and he needs to understand that this is harming your relationship. If you haven't, I think a serious conversation is in order. Not just about his kink! It's about your relationship, and how you both make each other feel good and valued. Ideally, you want to do this in person or over the phone.Here are some questions for you to consider before having that conversation:Do you feel like you can ask your bf for a total break from this kink, even if it's just for a short time? If you said ""I don't want to do any femdom or sissy play for 3 months."" would he honor that or would he react badly and punish you?Does your boyfriend understand why the cheating roleplay bothered you so much? Has he given you a heartfelt apology?Do your sexual and relational needs get met in this relationship? Is your boyfriend putting as much effort into your sexual preferences as you are into his?Is your boyfriend good at taking care of you after the scene? Physically and emotionally? This applies to both in person and long distance scenes.If you are looking at these questions and feeling like your needs aren't getting met, like your BF isn't putting in the effort that you are, like you're expected to service his kink no matter what, like a 3 month break would be a huge problem...you need to take a harder look at the foundation of your relationship.If all those things are good, and he just got a little carried away with a new shiny toy, you may be able to reset things by taking a break (again, I would say at least 3 months) from this particular kink and reinvest in other parts of your relationship. Good luck!","First of all, it's important to communicate with your boyfriend about your concerns. It sounds like you have been doing that to some extent, but it's important to keep the lines of communication open. If he is getting too obsessed with the fetish and ignoring your needs, tell him directly. He may not be aware of how much this is affecting you.It's also important to set boundaries with this fetish. If it is something that you are not comfortable with, make that clear to him. You should not feel like you have to do something that makes you uncomfortable just because he likes it.Finally, if he is not willing to respect your boundaries and is continuing to push the fetish on you in a way that is making you uncomfortable, you may need to consider ending the relationship. This is not something that you should have to put up with, and it is not worth sacrificing your own happiness for.",2b,helpful,writing

He said that he has always been interested in a certain sexual fetish, and never told anyone because he was quite embarrassed. The fetish was female domination, including ""sissy"" play, pegging, humiliation, etc. My BF is a highly educated man with a PhD from one of the top schools in the world. He's the President of a company and works long, stressful hours. He said that he was interested in femdom because it allowed him to be submissive and let go of his responsibilities for a bit.We had a pretty flavorful sex life already, and I consider myself to be quite open-minded, so I told him we could give it a try. I didn't *love* it and it didn't sexually excite me, but it wasn't that bad. Kind of fun, in a non-sexual way, once in a while. He seemed to really love it, so I didn't mind indulging once in a while.He started to get really obsessed with it, and it kind of consumed our long-distance sex life. I asked him to please dial it back a little bit, and he seemed really embarrassed but finally obliged after getting a bit upset with me.However, a few months later, he started to obsess again. It kind of took over our sexting sessions, our Skype sex, etc. I became annoyed and I talked to him about how big a part of our lives this was going to be. I told him that I was concerned about our sexual compatibility because I was fine with this as a once-in-a-while thing but not a lifestyle. He told me that it was just a bedroom thing and we didn't have to do it if I didn't want to.I'll mention that when we are together in person, he is not this obsessive. We do the femdom stuff like once a month, which is fine, because my needs are being met elsewhere. But when we're apart, he is so focused on it and it is really turning me off. HE turns me on, not these characters he plays. I don't like how he changes his appearance. Yesterday, he wanted to do some roleplay long-distance. He told me he had an idea. We have little cameras in our bedrooms so we can ""spy"" on each other. He wanted to pretend that someone had placed a secret camera in his bedroom and caught him doing sissy stuff, and then blackmailed him with it later. I would take screenshots through the camera and send them to him from a fake e-mail at a later time. Sounded fine to me.Except, in his scenario, we were ""us"" and he acted like he invited a ""woman"" over to dominate him behind my back. He acted like someone else was pegging him, like he needed a break to text me and tell me he was watching a movie, like he was making out with and touching another ""woman"", like ""she"" did him up in drag. And when I sent him screenshots as ""blackmail"", he begged me not to tell his girlfriend (me).I feel like my willingness to get into this for him is being taken advantage of. He knows I don't particularly enjoy it, but all his scenarios involve this femdom stuff. And I am SO hurt that he would incorporate cheating on me into this fantasy. I am honestly really devastated.I don't know what to do. He gets very embarrassed when I bring up his fetish in a negative way and I don't know what to say to him. It's going to destroy my attraction to him, and this fake cheating really hurt my feelings.What do I say? What do I do? When we are together, it is not like this, but I am scared to move and end up trapped in a relationship where we are always doing this.**tl;dr** BF told me about an embarrassing fetish a few months ago. I don't care for it but I am fine with indulging once in a while because he likes it so much. However, I feel like he is ignoring my needs in order to focus on this fetish, and our last ""roleplay"" was extremely hurtful for me.","This is something that can happen with kinky people who get to explore a new fetish - their interest in it overtakes their other sexual interests and makes them behave badly.Your bf is behaving badly, and he needs to understand that this is harming your relationship. If you haven't, I think a serious conversation is in order. Not just about his kink! It's about your relationship, and how you both make each other feel good and valued. Ideally, you want to do this in person or over the phone.Here are some questions for you to consider before having that conversation:Do you feel like you can ask your bf for a total break from this kink, even if it's just for a short time? If you said ""I don't want to do any femdom or sissy play for 3 months."" would he honor that or would he react badly and punish you?Does your boyfriend understand why the cheating roleplay bothered you so much? Has he given you a heartfelt apology?Do your sexual and relational needs get met in this relationship? Is your boyfriend putting as much effort into your sexual preferences as you are into his?Is your boyfriend good at taking care of you after the scene? Physically and emotionally? This applies to both in person and long distance scenes.If you are looking at these questions and feeling like your needs aren't getting met, like your BF isn't putting in the effort that you are, like you're expected to service his kink no matter what, like a 3 month break would be a huge problem...you need to take a harder look at the foundation of your relationship.If all those things are good, and he just got a little carried away with a new shiny toy, you may be able to reset things by taking a break (again, I would say at least 3 months) from this particular kink and reinvest in other parts of your relationship. Good luck!","First of all, it's important to communicate with your boyfriend about your concerns. It sounds like you have been doing that to some extent, but it's important to keep the lines of communication open. If he is getting too obsessed with the fetish and ignoring your needs, tell him directly. He may not be aware of how much this is affecting you.It's also important to set boundaries with this fetish. If it is something that you are not comfortable with, make that clear to him. You should not feel like you have to do something that makes you uncomfortable just because he likes it.Finally, if he is not willing to respect your boundaries and is continuing to push the fetish on you in a way that is making you uncomfortable, you may need to consider ending the relationship. This is not something that you should have to put up with, and it is not worth sacrificing your own happiness for.",2a,helpful,meaning

That way, she doesn't have to worry about you getting in trouble at work, and you still get to enjoy your weed.Another possibility is to try to find a different way to relax and unwind that doesn't involve smoking weed. Maybe you can go for a run or listen to music instead. If you can find a way to relax that doesn't bother her, then she may be more open to you smoking weed.Ultimately, it's up to you and your girlfriend to figure out what works best for both of you.

Normally these threads start with ""they are just such a great partner, I truly love them, blah blah""Because based on what I just read I'd consider leaving her.

We both smoked a lot of weed and although it’s not the only thing we have in common it’s how we started hanging out and eventually dating.I eventually got clean and got a good job now that I could pass a piss test. I learned how to cheat on the randoms and began smoking again. I’ve successfully passed 3 random drug screens so far. My income is good enough that I’ve been able to get a house and support my girlfriend through college after she quit her job for mental health reasons. I do all this while still getting high.Her mom eventually got into her head and said I’m going to lose my job over weed. I’ve always had the sneaking suspicion that the only reason her mom likes me is because my income. Because her mom convinced her of this, my girlfriend asked me to stop smoking. However, she refused to also quit. I saw this as a very hypocritical and controlling thing so I refused.Now my girlfriend is on my ass all the time about smoking. She will literally slap a blunt out of my hand so now I only smoke while she’s gone but she still fusses at me. And to make it worse she is smoking my weed. I have a pretty decent stash in jars and vacuum seals to last months. She can’t afford her own and she claims she has to smoke for her mental health problems. She says if I cut off her access her sister will smoke her out anyway so I don’t think that will work.We have gotten in several arguments over this. I tell her I’m a grown man, I pay bills, and I’m not going to lose my job. Therefore, what I do in my free time shouldn’t matter. I work 60 hours a week and it’s how I unwind and recharge. I also tell her she’s being controlling.What do I do?","It sounds like you and your girlfriend are at an impasse.

If he was just trying to catch up with an old friend, he would not have been so secretive about it and he would not have been asking her personal questions about her boyfriend and her job. It sounds like he was trying to see if there was still a possibility of getting back together with her, and that is not something you should tolerate in a relationship. Gaslighting is a form of emotional abuse, and it sounds like your fiancé may be trying to gaslight you into thinking you are overreacting. Don't let him do that.

Like I’ve never been messaged by a girl first (unless it’s was bumble where they have to). Like I read girls bios and they will be like “I won’t message first”, “you have to message me first”, or “I won’t message first”? I’m not shy or anything and don’t mind doing it. But when girls write something like that it just turns me off.I’m 5’9 so I feel like I’m a good height and don’t have a problem with how tall I am but something that turns me off too is when girls write “if you’re not taller than 5’7 swipe left” etc. I fit the requirement but it still bugs me. Like I can understand wanting a guy that’s at least your height but just saying that turns me off.Do guys do stuff similar to this on the females perspective of tinder? At least for me, that’s like a guy saying “if your boobs aren’t a certain size swipe left”. Idk just my two cents, it just seems kinda rude and turns me off.","My experience on tinder here in Brazil: I have always messaged guys first as I am very talktive/extrovert. But because of that I have been judge as an easy women, desperate (because I don't play games/playing hard to get).So I can agree that sometimes women play hard to get and the ones who don't maybe don't message to obey the general social construction. It ends up being a commum thing as judging women to be more sensitive and men to not be. It's a behaviour. A behaviour that I don't like nor agree with but it's.","It's understandable that you're wondering why it's generally expected for guys to message first on dating apps.

We have 2 children,  ages 3yrs and 1.5 yrs old. My wife wants a 3rd and I don't - its causing some serious strife as we are both dead set in those feelings.From the beginning of our relationship we have always talked about the future, and been very open about what we each wanted. My wife always mentioned she wanted at least 2 kids, and possibly more. I always mentioned I did not have an ideal number but would want to take it one at a time rather than committing to a specific number.Fast forward 10 years, we're married, have a house, well paying jobs and 2 amazing children I would move heaven and earth for. I knew the moment our second was born that I didn't want to go through the process again, I looked at it as a closed chapter in my life and looked forward to the challenges of raising these kids into contributing members of society as a team. My wife even made comments right after our seconds birth that she wasn't sure if she wanted to go through pregnancy again.1.5 years later she tells me she wants to start planning for a 3rd and asked how I felt. I was honest and told her it wasn't something I wanted to do, and that I was quite content and occupied with 2 kids. She immediately became upset, crying etc. She came back to the topic a couple days later and rather aggressively demanded reasons as to why I didn't want a 3rd. I explained that it wasn't something I want to do, ergo its something I do not want to do. Simple as that. I work a stressful job (as does she) and end up dropping off and picking up the kids from childcare and taking care of them solo most nights and weekends as she is a shift worker. In my deepest of deepest feelings the thought of managing 3 children at once gives me instant anxiety and negative vibes. I already feel as if splitting my attention between the 2 is not right, I'm still getting used to the idea of not having just one child I suppose. The thought of having another is just a full hard no in my soul. She feels being a mother is her calling (and she's right - she's an amazing mother) and wants to keep at it. I'm at the opposite end of the spectrum, I'm not nearly as confident and was never truly ""ready"" when it came to having kids - but am glad I did. I love being a father.Things got worse when we had a date night without the kids. She quickly opened the topic as we ate, I confirmed I still felt the same way as I did before, and was unlikely to change my mind. She was upset and told me ""I wish I knew this before we got married, I should have married a family man"". Then proceeded to tell me I have to compromise on 3 children because she actually wants 4! I kept my cool, told her bringing humans into the world is not something that should begin on a compromise, or from a parent without total commitment. She proceed to present an ultimatum thinly disguised as a suggestion. ""I'm not sure what this means for our relationship"". I ended the conversation by suggesting we go to see a counselor, she did not like the idea.I've never had such a hard time in a relationship. It seems we're both dead set on our position.

I don’t even want to give two weeks if I do because I’m so anxious and stressed.","It is important to check your state's labor laws to see what protections are in place for workers regarding hours and scheduling. It is possible that your employer is violating your rights by mandating excessive hours and changing your schedule without notice. If this is the case, you may want to consider filing a complaint with the state labor board or an attorney.","Are you receiving your legally mandated breaks?

There are other reasons too but I’d say these are the main ones.A few months ago I researched online and learnt about breast reduction surgery.

She returned to the USA this most recent Sunday the 2nd of February early in the morning. She was in an area of china very far away from Wuhan and for the past two weeks she stayed at home the entire time she was in china. When leaving she went through a temperature screening at the airport there and nothing else was required of her health wise at Seatac. There are no govt mandated quarantines in any way at the moment. She decided she would stay home for two weeks anyways just to be safe but realistically the chance of having any dangerous virus is probably lower than catching the flu.Only one neighbor of mine knew my wife was out of town in any ways and I told them when she would be returning. On Monday the 3rd, A property manager with our HOA condo's came to our door while I was at work and yelled at my wife telling her she can't be here and has to leave because she went to china. This morning posted all around only our condo unit was flyers saying that a person in unit xxx has returned from china and was under Corona virus quarantine and is very dangerous and you should avoid them.This type of posting is intentionally ostracizing my wife and making her feel unwelcome to even be here, especially after suffering such a family hardship.

She also told me she had hooked up with and ex boyfriend a while after we had broken up when she was drunk. I got over it and mostly just blamed myself. Fast forward 15 years later we have 3 kids and things are a little Rocky. We have gotten in a few fights and she had mentioned she should have stayed with her ex when we broke up. We went to marriage counseling which really made things better until she ended up telling me that when she left me it was because she moved in with him and had been living with him for 3 months. When things didn't work out she left him and moved back in with me. This changes everything. I am so bothered by this I can't get over it. It went from her leaving me and having fun single to her leaving me and living with another man. ( He died of a drug overdose 10 years ago.) What should I do? I can't forgive her and we have three little kids and an upper class life we have built together. I mean we were 20 years old when this happened.,"This woman dated you for two years, left you for three months  and then demanded you change things about yourself so she could be with you.

He thinks this violates doctor patient confidentiality and even thinks we should report her. I’m not sure I agree. For one, I’m not sure she was violating any sort of oath. She didn’t mention us by name and for all her friends know the story could be made up. Second, we’ve loved her so far and I don’t think this affects her ability to counsel us, plus my socially awkward ass is too uncomfortable to even bring it up. I’m unsure what to do now, I’m tempted to just give into what my fiancé wants, but I really do like her and definitely don’t wanna report her, not to mention I don’t wanna go through the process of finding another counselor and building up trust again.",No wonder you guys are in counselling. Your partner doesn’t feel comfortable with her anymore and you don’t care because it’s too much effort to find a new one.,"If you're uncomfortable with the situation, it's probably not worth it to confront your counselor. You could try talking to her about it after your next session, but if she doesn't seem receptive, it might be best to find a new counselor.",1a,helpful,meaning

Please help!My (37M) mother (72F) died in January without a legal will. Her condo is now in the probate process with me named as the ""personal representative of the estate."" My sister (39F) has a borderline personality disorder, bipolar, malignant narcissism, take your pick. She has been diagnosed with all of them. I had no contact with her for about two years after she lost all custody and even supervision of her son and was formerly evicted from my father's (72M) home, who she was elder abusing to the point where he had to move out or was going to be consumed by depression.My wife and I handled everything quickly and kept my mother's funeral small because of my sister. We had difficulty even contacting her, and we had to go through her former social worker and the half-way house where she lives now. Also, another tragedy is my sister has the right credentials to keep getting teaching jobs at these garbage charter schools in Michigan who can't talk to each other because of HIPAA rules. I blame Betsy DeVos for that. She will get a job until she does something to get fired and then picks up another one almost immediately. She's also been in rehab for 15+ years but has been kicked out of the AA/NA community for targeting and exploiting people as well as harassing them online. Trust me when I say she is an absolute toxic monster who I need out of my life again, except now I own a condo with her 50/50. My mother was also a hoarder so it's going to be a big effort to clean everything out and get it sold.Since the funeral, my sister posted selfies to social media she took with the casket she insisted get opened. My wife and I tried our best to persuade her to take them down. Up until this point, she was still liking us since we wired her gas money and paid for her hotel stay. However, this turned things adversarial immediately, and she started up with extortion attempts as well as trying to embarrass us online. None of this is new to us so we've just been collecting this potential criminal evidence not responding to any of her antics.Anyways, we plan to do a remembrance ceremony in April around my mother's birthday on Earthday, but now I'm thinking I don't tell my sister any of the details. I'm certainly not helping her get down to Florida again. I'm struggling to focus at work, and I feel like I cannot properly grieve until my sister is again out of my life.My mother was also being financially exploited and abused by my sister until my mother cut off all contact about two years ago. This past year has been an ongoing crisis where she bounced between the hospital and assisted living as well as recovery periods living near me. I set her up at two assisted living facilities, but she insisted on going back to living on her own. Our guardianship petition failed because she displayed a lot of same manipulation tactics that my sister gets away with. Ultimately she fell and died in her home two days after I had the state social services do a wellness check.Suffice it to say, I'm nearly at the end of my rope in terms of ability to deal with any of this. We have a great probate attorney, and I've already got a Realtor ready to sell the condo. I just have to get it emptied, and it will sell quickly since it's in a desirable area. After all is said and done, there will be about $20k to split between my sister and me.I will give it to her along with a full and proper accounting, but giving her any money is a bad move. I'm on really good terms with her ex-husband and her son my nephew (9M). I asked my former brother-in-law if he could have his lawyer talk to my probate lawyer and get this money garnished for her back child support. My mother would have wanted the money to go to support her grandson anyways. However, he said while she does owe plenty of back child support, he wants zero legal entanglements with her so he doesn't pursue it. He views her being in such arrears as a way to keep her away. He is though worried that if she does a lump sum of money she will hire a lawyer and pursue getting some visitation rights restored.After the latest round of garbage on social media from my sister trying to embarrass and control us, my wife, and I almost reached out to local law enforcement and/or the FBI to get a case going for her extortion attempts. I believe it's wired fraud and a felony since it's across state lines. Her text exactly to me and my wife separately was: ""I want all moms stuff shipped to me in Michigan and the condo completely gutted & upgraded by 2/14 with spending money for me in the kitchen drawer & a year rent paid at both of my properties."" She then said she wants to turn the condo into a production studio as she sees herself as an Instagram star, rapper, business executive ... I can't keep up. I'm worried the police would say she's just mentally ill when they see ""Mom left me her book of spells in Florida.""At least one other person has gone to court and spent $30k to stop her online harassment and get a personal protective order filed against her. As far as I know she just ignores such things, and there doesn't seem to be any consequence. We have gotten various friends to report to Facebook the things she is posting about me and my wife, but we all get back a stock message saying it does not violate their standards. Any other ideas?

I am not close with any of my step siblings and don't consider them family, my mom gets very sad when I say I don't consider them family so to avoid any conflict with my mom I just avoid everyone all together a bit.So they asked me if I wanted to watch a movie with them on Saturday they called ""movie night"". The problem was that I was about to head to my dad's for the weekend so I declined. I probably would have just watched the movie with them if I didn't go to my dad's but I haven't seen him in about 2 weeks and I really wanted to go see him again.My mom was not happy that I went to my dad's instead of the movie night. Saying that I'm ""keeping them at arms distance"" and that I ""could have just left after the movie"". The thing is that it was around 10 and I probably wouldn't get to leave till around 11 and get to my dad's at 12 so he would have been asleep.Should I have stayed and watched a movie with them? Or was I right to leave?TL;DR:My step siblings and half sister invited me to watch a movie with them but I was about to head to my dad's who I haven't seen in 2 weeks when they asked me and I declined them","It sounds like you made the right decision for you in this situation.

HR required me to have my doctor fill out FMLA forms and turn them in before the procedure, which I did with the expectation (although not having been told as much) that only HR and maybe upper management would have access to the form and the medical information contained therein. I turned in the paperwork by hand because I knew the fax machine was accessible by all of HR, upper and lower management, about 20 other various employees, and could be peeked at by anyone having a discussion with HR, interviewing for a job, or having new hire orientation as they walked past it.Because I did not want anyone at work knowing what the procedure was, I told everyone who asked why I was going on leave of absence that I was having a different, completely unrelated surgery. I did not post about it on social media aside from a glib remark that I survived surgery, and nobody who I told the actual nature of the procedure to knew then or knows now anyone related to my company.Today a coworker mentioned the procedure to me, and when I asked how he knew about it he told me that a lower-level manager that I never really got along with told him and a group of other people about it and proceeded to belittle me about it and my breakup with a same-sex partner the year before. In the intervening time he has said things to me that I thought were insensitive but did not seem to be malicious so much as a display of his lack of intelligence, and the comments did not give away that he knew the actual nature of my procedure. However, in light of this new information it seems like many of those things could have been covertly malicious. I do not have detailed records of these comments, like I would if I thought they were malicious before now.While this matter bears more investigation and questioning of people related before I take any other action, I would like to know:1. Is HR legally responsible for keeping information like this from members of management who do not need to know?2. Did HR violate any laws either through failing to safeguard my information from snooping, allowing this manager access to my FMLA paperwork, or actually telling him the contents of it?3. Does the manager revealing this information to other coworkers violate any privacy laws?4. Does the manager using this information to belittle me constitute harassment?

I don't want to get involved in a protracted legal battle with a company who can afford to throw ten thousand times as much money as I can at lawyers to draw it out until I get bankrupted. Should my questioning lead to any conclusive evidence that this all happened, I intend to report what I know to corporate HR and allow them to handle the matter internally. My company has particularly unreliable HR that's really good at the ""do as little as possible to keep from getting sued"" approach to HR.

REV. STAT. Ann. §§ 165.535, 165.540 by secretly recording our CEO during a private in person meeting. He never asked if it was OK and I didn't know he recorded the conversation until afterwords. I also reported that our support team has been secretly recording room and Online audio by way of skype, microsoft teams, and Zoom conferencing software.Ever since making those reports, the people I named (including my boss) have been hostile towards me, and my boss even put me on a vaguely worded preformance plan. I have since reported 2 other employees for harassing me and even had coworkers asking me why they were so hostile.I have been working closely with internal audit recently and last night the Director of Internal Audit wanted to speak to me ASAP about a recent ethic questionnaire.This morning I go in and she asks me why I said i didn't feel comfortable reporting an ethics violation at work. I told her what violations I've reported and who was involved and said that I was the only person who could know these events occurred, so I would be singled out as the whitleblower. Also that it was my boss who broke the law, so fear of retribution was real.She understood my fears and assured me that nobody would know I was the one who reported this and it would be anonymous...5 Hours later i'm sitting at my bosses desk with the HR rep i reported the ethics complaint to and I'm being told that this is my last day of employment. I ask for specifics and receive none. I ask for information on who to contact for legal questions and I'm only given a name.I've reached out to the Oregon state bar for a referral and have a whistle-blower protection packet coming in the mail.Anything else i can do?","If you have been fired for reporting illegal and unethical behavior at your company, you may want to consult with an attorney to discuss your legal options.

I'm willing to pay this balance but I cannot do it in full and if I start making payments she will simply max it out again. Is there anything that I can do to get out from under her. I had no idea that I was so financially tied to her until now, and she did it all while I was underage... Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated.","If your mother has drained your savings account without your knowledge or consent, you may be able to file a police report for theft. However, it may be difficult to prove that your mother acted without your consent, so you may need to provide evidence that she had no legal right to access the account. If you are able to prove that your mother stole the money from your account, you may be able to recover the funds through the civil courts.If you are concerned about your credit score, you should first check your credit report to see if there are any errors that you can dispute. If you find that your mother has been maxing out your credit card and causing your score to suffer, you can contact the credit card company and close the account. You may also want to consider cutting ties with your mother financially, which may mean closing any joint accounts and cutting her off from your credit cards.","Since this was a joint account, your mom had every right the access the money. The bank did nothing wrong here in allowing her to access money in an account for which she is an account holder.Your only recourse would be to sue your mom for the money. You'd have to prove it was yours and only yours. Winning the suit isn't a slam dunk and neither is collecting on the judgement if you get one.",1a,helpful,writing
