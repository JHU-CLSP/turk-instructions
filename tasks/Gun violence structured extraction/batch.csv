None of this would have happened if the <span class=Keyword>criminals</span> wouldn't have attemptedtheir crime. Lets talk about some real action, <span class=City>Orting</span> City Council needs to get off their duffs and make the Citysafer- how many morecrimes will happen in <span class=City>Orting</span>? <span class=Company>Google</span> that fact!</p> <p>Last thing Iwant tosayisto the <span class=Keyword>criminals</span> that did this,since youweren't alone that night I would be watching my back because every criminal that ever had an accomplice was turned in by the <span class=Keyword>person</span> whowas with them.</p> <p>Why do I say criminals, because cowards never act alone!</p> <p>another city with no cops on the road at night do to costs. shifts are going unfilled everywhere. you are on your own from 2am until 8am in a lot of places as the cop(s) has to be called out of his/her house from bed to answer important calls. everywhere cops don't patrol at night burglaries and other crime are way up.</p> <p>Just having a <span class=Keyword>gun</span> in your hands does not make you omnipotent. If you intend to use it for more than a threat, you need to take to the range and shoot it, learn how to clean it, and then get into good enough shape to not have it taken away easily. A lot of people get shot by their own <span class=Keyword>gun</span> because they are not as strong as their opponent, including cops.</p> <p><span class=TwitterHandle>@calapete</span>  Hey calapete. I know that you are justtrying to promote <span class=Keyword>anti-gun sentiment</span> and haveread the comments directed atyou. The majority of the comments showhow the community feels about using a <span class=Keyword>gun</span> for personal defense around the <span class=Facility>Puget Sound Area</span>. As far as I'm concerned, and this is my opinion I wont back with links, the people who need to be anti-gun and anti-self or <span class=Keyword>home defense</span> are those we need to be protected from. Even a <span class=HealthCondition>LEO</span> below agrees although he's trying to take a swing at me in the process.</p> <p><span class=TwitterHandle>@calapete</span> Sounds like the shotgun was either stolen while in the garage (???) or was it taken from the victim? If it was stolen during the <span class=Crime>burglary</span> that's sad... Should have been locked up in a safe or disabled in some other way. I never leave home without securing them, unloaded in a safe. I've always had that fear of coming home and someone arming themselves with my weapons to use against me.</p> <p><span class=TwitterHandle>@calapete</span>  this <span class=Keyword>person</span> is not dead because he owned a gun. He is dead because a criminal killed him. The blame must be placed on the criminal, not a law abiding citizen who did nothing wrong. Taking away or reducing the rights of citizens does not prevent crime because <span class=Keyword>criminals</span> do not follow the rules. So simple. But, <span class=Keyword>common sense</span> is not that common. If you are afraid of a gun, don't have one but stay off my right to own one.</p> <p><span class=TwitterHandle>@witchitalineman</span>  - unfortunately he did, regardless.</p> <p>My condolences also to the family and friends of this man.</p> <p>Unfortunately, this happens all too often - where a <span class=Keyword>gun</span> is used to harm the owner or the family instead of actually being useful in protecting one's family or one's self.</p> <p>You never go into a situation like that unless you plan to -and are capable of- shooting the human being that is the intruder or 'bad guy'. You learn how to approach a closed space and a 'bad guy' so that you are far less likely tolose your weapon to them or get into a knock down with them.</p> <p>A <span class=Keyword>gun</span> does not make you superman - in fact, it's likely to help you lose some of the <span class=Keyword>common sense</span> and cause you to inappropriately increase your risk taking so that this kind of thing is more likely to happen. It takes mental effort to -not- have this happen. that's why the military and the cops have such in-depth training in the use of weapons and tactics. Joe Average <span class=Keyword>gun</span> owner doesn't.</p> <p><span class=TwitterHandle>@aprilday</span> <span class=TwitterHandle>@calapete</span><span class=TwitterHandle>@johnbe</span>  Well said aprilday. I prefer to stay asarmed as I canbut lean to the side of safety. I keep a GunVault (G21SF/G23) safe on each floor for quick access if ever needed but when not needed they are stored in a way to prevent negligent use. There are fools that should not own guns but taking away my rights because others are stupid is not really a good option. And with that said I am in no way this victim was being stupid, sad it turned out this way. Blame the <span class=Keyword>criminals</span> not the <span class=Keyword>person</span> attempting to defend his home. Again , your comments are well stated and I totally agree.</p> <p><span class=TwitterHandle>@johnbe</span> <span class=TwitterHandle>@FormerMarineSgt</span> then there would be hundreds of similar examples of homeowners killed by intruders annually then. BS! I am a <span class=HealthCondition>LEO</span> and I have never been to one but been to dozens of calls where <span class=Keyword>armed homeowners</span> have SUCCESSFULLY thwarted invasion and attack. I have done it myself. The odds are always in the <span class=Keyword>armed homeowners</span> favor. You are either a liar or grossly misinformed. Either way, you and your foolishignorance constitute a greater danger than the armed civilian in my humble opinion.Arm yourself people and get some training. Or you can be a victim. The choice is yours.</p> <p><span class=TwitterHandle>@calapete</span> <span class=TwitterHandle>@johnbe</span>  this <span class=Keyword>person</span> is not dead because he owned a gun. He is dead because a criminal killed him. The blame must be placed on the criminal, not a law abiding citizen who did nothing wrong. Taking away or reducing the rights of citizens does not prevent crime because <span class=Keyword>criminals</span> do not follow the rules. So simple.

If you are afraid of a gun, don't have one but stay off my right to own one.</p> <p><span class=TwitterHandle>@FormerMarineSgt</span> <span class=TwitterHandle>@johnbe</span> Even the <span class=Keyword>best trained Soldiers</span> and Marines can be outnumbered and overpowered with deadly results. We both know that. That is what training is all about. It has nothing to do with the promotion of <span class=Keyword>gun</span> ownership. Any <span class=Keyword>gun</span> self defense class will teach that right up front. For example, they will teach you that you never get closer to the enemy than <span class=Quantity>21 feet</span> if you can help it. And never use a <span class=Keyword>gun</span> to try to scare someone. The list goes on.</p> <p>As far as arguments go, I'll stick by my original post. My post will always reflect the nature of the article. If someone chooses to change the scope of this incident, that's their choice, but you and I both know that <span class=Keyword>gun</span> ownership goes far beyond what went on here. My statement addresses only incidents such as the one in <span class=City>Orting</span>.</p> <p>I assume that you are saying that my information is false.

Extract important information from articles about gun violence.,Read articles and pull out key facts to help us answer questions about gun violence across the country.,"English, research, politics",http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/a-few-simple-ideas-about-gun-control,"<p>Two more thoughts about gun control: one practical and immediate, the other more abstract and academic, though with a <span class=Keyword>practical fork</span> in its tail.  The practical comes from a <span class=Keyword>recent discussion</span> with my father, about, of all things, shooting raccoons. The Gopnik family seat, such as it is, is nowhere near <span class=City>Manhattan</span>, Upper West or East Side, but rather a farm in remote rural <span class=StateOrCounty>Ontario</span>, where my parents live surrounded by crops, animals, and pestsand indeed by farmers who need and use rifles. When I was talking to my father there last weekend, we discussed a recent raccoon infestation, and how he had called on a neighbor with a rifle to hightail it over to shoot the five <span class=Keyword>unfortunate masked marauders</span> beneath the back porch. (My dad buried them afterward, further proof that English professors can be eminently practical people.) My dad is actually a pretty good shot, and could have done it himselfbut he had not finished the paperwork for his gun.</p> <p>What onerous tasks are involved in getting a gun for the necessary work of <span class=Keyword>rural life</span> in <span class=Country>Canada</span>? Well, you have to do that paperwork, fill out an application for a license, take a gun-safety course, and then you have your raccoon-shootin rifle for the grim work of keeping off pests. (There are some other controls; if you have a longstanding dispute, for instance, your spouse is informed.) Does anything in this interfere with the liberty of the individual or the exigencies of rural life? No one disputes that there are sane reasons for ordinary people to need a rifle. But there is no imaginable, meaningful sense in which Canadians, or Australians, are less free when it comes to guns because they have to take a safety course before they use one. People who really need gunsand many, my folks among them, docan get them and use them safely, while there are hedgerows, so to speak, against impulsive purchases or unsafe or frankly homicidal use.</p> <p>What we can learn from <span class=Country>Canada</span> is how to legislate common sense without violating anyones libertyunless you imagine that anyones liberty depends on having as many weapons as he wants whenever he wants them. Perhaps no existing <span class=Keyword>gun law</span> could have been explicitly designed to stop the shotgun killer of the <span class=Facility>Navy Yard</span>. But to repeat the central truth of modern criminology: <span class=Keyword>building low barriers</span> against violent crime has a disproportionate effect in ending it. Make something difficult and you begin to make it impossible. You dont have to back-engineer every law to cover every past criminal circumstance; you just have to sensibly craft laws to discourage the next one.</p> <p>While in <span class=Country>Canada</span>, I also had a chance to read a helpful <span class=Keyword>new academic book</span> about <span class=Keyword>gun control</span> farther south, Reducing Gun Violence in <span class=Continent>America</span>, which I urge on all who want to catch up on the scientific news on the subject. (Though the <span class=Keyword>gun lobby</span> will find its subtitleInforming Policy with Evidence and Analysisutterly alarming.) The book, just out from the <span class=Organization><span class=PrintMedia>Johns Hopkins</span> University Press</span>, is an anthology of studies, condensing and summarizing the actual state of our knowledge about the subject of <span class=Keyword>gun violence</span> in this countrywhat real, tested social science shows, not the three million marauders have been stopped just by the sight of my revolver! anecdotes. It also makes some simple recommendations.</p> <p>In particular, there are four ideas agreed to by all the academic researchers involved in the project. First, fix the background-check system by doing small things such as giving the <span class=Organization>F.B.I.</span> <span class=Quantity>ten days</span>, instead of three, to complete them; prohibiting high-risk individuals from getting their hands on guns (anyone with a restraining order filed against him for a threat of violence, for example); and accelerating federal legislation to keep the violent and mentally ill from having guns. Second, make the A.T.F. more effective through such simple measures as getting the agency a <span class=JobTitle>director</span>. Third, encourage research on personalized guns and gun triggers. Fourth, ban <span class=Crime>assault</span> weapons, carefully defined, and with them magazines that fire more than ten rounds. And finallyradical ideafund research on what actually works to end gun violence.</p> <p>None of these things may pass <span class=Organization>Congress</span> next week, or even next year, nor are they even remotely Canadian in impactbut they define a common-sense agenda whose promotion will, at a minimum, once again expose the irrational savagery of the gun lobby. Reducing Gun Violence in <span class=Continent>America</span> also provides <span class=Person>Mayor Bloomberg</span>, who wrote the foreword, a chance to lay out four things that the <span class=JobTitle>President</span> could do on his own, even in the face of our fanatic <span class=Organization>Congress</span>. They are, in order, to appoint that A.T.F. <span class=JobTitle>director</span> at last; order every <span class=FieldTerminology>federal agency</span> to submit the relevant data on <span class=Keyword>gun violence</span> to the <span class=Keyword>national background-check database</span> (Every missing record is a potential <span class=Crime>murder</span> in the making); have the <span class=Organization>Justice Department</span> prosecute criminals who lie during background checks (seventy-six thousand such cases were referred to the D.O.J. by the <span class=Organization>F.B.I.</span> in 2010, but fewer than four dozen prosecuted); and to stop supporting the Tiahrt order, which, unbelievably, prevents the A.T.F. even from releasing information about <span class=Keyword>gun traffickers</span> and how they operate. (More broadly, the <span class=Keyword>good departing Mayor</span> suggests that the whole mechanism by which <span class=Organization>Congress</span> actively prohibits scientific research on <span class=Keyword>gun violence</span> could be short-circuited by a determined <span class=JobTitle>President</span>.) These seem like minimal actslittle more than gestures, perhapsbut eminently doable and even politically practical. What are the <span class=JobTitle>President</span>s opponents going to do? Hate him more?</p> <p><span class=Person>Justice Stevens</span>, in his eloquent, essential dissent in the <span class=Organization>Supreme Court</span>s <span class=Person>Heller</span> case, shows that the history of the <span class=FieldTerminology>Second Amendment</span> makes abundantly clear that the Amendment should not be interpreted as limiting the authority of <span class=Organization>Congress</span> to regulate the use or possession of firearms for <span class=Keyword>purely civilian purposes.</span> In other words, no form of <span class=Keyword>gun control</span> like those proposed by the <span class=PrintMedia>Johns Hopkins</span> authors is even remotely in violation of the Constitution properly understood. But Stevens was on the losing side; <span class=Person>Heller</span>, decided in 2008, affirmed our embrace of gun madness, by a vote of 54. There was once a time when the <span class=Organization>Supreme Court</span> sought to decide hard cases only with strong majorities. These days, with a highly politicized Court, huge decisionswho will be <span class=JobTitle>President</span>? Can a health-care law, duly passed by <span class=Organization>Congress</span>, survive <span class=Person>Justice Scalia</span>s hatred of broccoli?are routinely determined on 54 votes. To restore some balance to gun laws in <span class=Continent>America</span> might require a fifth Justice who, like <span class=Person>Justice Stevens</span>, can read and reason. Meanwhile, a thousand smaller sanities may save the day, or at least a few lives.</p> <p>Photograph by <span class=Person>Mark Ovaska/Redux</span>.</p>",A Few Simple Ideas About Gun Control - The New Yorker,10/1/13,"Justice Stevens, Justice Scalia, Mayor Bloomberg, Mark Ovaska/Redux, Heller",Manhattan,Ontario,,,on,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10/1/13,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,unknown,unknown,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Extract important information from articles about gun violence.,Read articles and pull out key facts to help us answer questions about gun violence across the country.,"English, research, politics",http://www.politico.com/story/2013/09/colorado-recall-guns-referendum-96566.html,"<p><span class=StateOrCounty><span class=City>Colo</span>rado</span>s state senate <span class=JobTitle>president</span> and another legislator have conceded in an <span class=Keyword>unprecedented recall election</span> triggered by their push for stricter <span class=Keyword>gun control</span> measures. The outcome is likely to be viewed as a referendum on the hot-button issue that has divided the country this year.</p> <p>The senate leader, <span class=Person>John Morse</span> of <span class=StateOrCounty><span class=City>Colo</span>rado</span> Springs, and state <span class=Person>Sen. Angela Giron</span> of the Democratic-leaning city of <span class=City>Pueblo</span> were targeted by a highly contentious <span class=Keyword>recall effort</span> that drew big-name donors on both sides of the debate. The legislative <span class=Keyword>recall effort</span> is the first in state history.</p> <p>With about 80 percent of voted counted, the <span class=PrintMedia><span class=City>Denver</span> Post</span> and other <span class=FieldTerminology>local media</span> outlets reported that <span class=Keyword>Morse</span> had conceded Tuesday night. The final counts showed <span class=Keyword>Morse</span> was voted out 50.9-49 percent. Giron was ousted 56 percent to 44 percent.</p> <p>(PHOTOS: Stars call for gun control)</p> <p>We as the <span class=Organization>Democratic Party</span> will continue to fight, <span class=Keyword>Morse</span> pledged.</p> <p>National figures and groups weighing in on the race ranged from <span class=City>New York City</span> Mayor <span class=Person>Michael <span class=Company>Bloomberg</span></span>, a vocal champion of tighter gun restrictions, to the <span class=Organization>National Rifle Association</span> on the other side of the spectrum. The <span class=Organization>Republican National Committee</span> and <span class=Organization>Democratic National Committee</span> both had some staffers on the ground assisting the campaigns, and <span class=Company>Bloomberg</span>s anti-gun violence group, Mayors Against Illegal Guns, had about 30 people on the ground.</p> <p>Morse  who represented a more liberal part of a county that strongly backed <span class=Person>Mitt Romney</span> in 2012 and Giron were key advocates of <span class=Keyword>gun control</span> measures in the state <span class=Organization>Senate</span>, which included stipulations such as <span class=Keyword>universal background checks</span> and limits on the amount of ammunition a gun can carry. That debate unfolded in the aftermath of last years shooting massacres in <span class=City>Newtown</span>, <span class=StateOrCounty>Conn.</span>, and <span class=City>Aurora</span>, <span class=City>Colo</span>., and came as <span class=Keyword>gun control</span> advocates made a push in Congress, which ultimately failed.</p> <p>(PHOTOS: <span class=Organization>Senate</span> guns hearing)</p> <p>The results tonight will certainly be interpreted through the lens of the national gun debate, said <span class=City>Denver</span>-based independent <span class=JobTitle>political analyst</span> <span class=Person>Eric Sondermann</span>. About whether its safe to pursue this kind of legislation or whether to do it at your political peril.</p> <p>The recall sparked a series of lawsuits ahead of <span class=FieldTerminology>Election Day</span>. A Quinnipiac poll from late last month found voters overwhelmingly opposed to recall efforts  60 percent said its better to wait for elections when there is disagreement with a legislator than to pursue a recall  even as they also disagreed with the gun measures in question. But the outcome was ultimately decided by voters in only two districts, both of which were saturated with ads and get-out-the-vote efforts.</p> <p><span class=Person>Rick Ridder</span>, a Democratic strategist based in <span class=City>Denver</span>, sought to downplay the national implications, saying that the two areas in play dont necessarily reflect the attitudes of the state or the country.</p> <p>(WATCH: <span class=Person>Obama</span> remarks following <span class=City>Aurora</span>, <span class=City>Colo</span>., theater shooting)</p> <p>It is clear to me that there is a group of activists that wanted to send a message about two people in two parts of the state, and their support of gun legislation, he said. Do I think its reflective of the state? No. Do I think its reflective of the overall mood? No. Do I think think anyone should take anything out of this other than this could be a trend about using recalls? Thats the only thing I could see as really national.</p> <p>But <span class=Person>Tamra Farah</span>, who is leading recall efforts of Morse, said in an interview that all eyes are on <span class=StateOrCounty><span class=City>Colo</span>rado</span> to see how gun-rights activists respond to such legislation.</p> <p>We all know things usually start small when rights are being attacked, she said. They are chipped away at incrementally. Absolutely the nation is watching to see if <span class=City>Colo</span>radans will tolerate that.</p> <p>(Also on <span class=PrintMedia>POLITICO</span>: DNC chair: Vote 'suppression' in <span class=City>Colo</span>.)</p> <p>Mark Glaze, director of Mayors Against Illegal Guns, said in an interview ahead of the final results that until recently, there hadnt been an organized, well-financed push to challenge the NRA, and pledged to keep fighting.</p> <p>That created a chilling effect thats been in place for two decades, he said. What were seeing is a thaw. Mayor <span class=Company>Bloomberg</span> and thousands of other people around the country contributed money, sweat and tears getting bills passed, limiting the scope of this recall effort, that in fact will encourage more people to do the right thing over time. But its going to take time.</p> <p>This may also be viewed as a political test, beyond gun policy, for Republicans who have struggled in <span class=StateOrCounty><span class=City>Colo</span>rado</span> since <span class=Person>President George W. Bush</span> won the state in 2004, Sondermann said.</p> <p>If <span class=Keyword>Morse</span> and Giron both survive, it just continues the <span class=Keyword>Republican losing streak</span> around here that now dates back to 2004; it will be a further morale deflater for them if that happens, he said. But if the effort is successful, I do think it would be noted around the country. I have to believe that the state representatives, the state senators in this and that state, would walk a little more hesitantly in this debate.</p>",Colorado lawmakers recalled over guns - Katie Glueck - POLITICO.com,9/10/13,"John Morse, Sen.

The <span class=Keyword>police</span> say that <span class=Person>Elliot Morales</span>, 33, trailed and taunted two men, yelling <span class=Person>antigay</span> slurs and asking one of them, You want to die tonight?</p> <p>The <span class=Keyword>police</span> say it was the other man, <span class=Person>Mark Carson</span>, 32, who died after <span class=Keyword>Mr. Morales</span> fired a single bullet from a revolver.</p> <p>On Sunday, the <span class=Keyword>police</span> filed <span class=Crime>murder</span> and weapons charges against Mr. Morales, and several lesbian and <span class=Keyword>gay groups</span> made plans for a march on Monday to the scene of the shooting. And, as he had on Saturday, the <span class=FieldTerminology>police commissioner</span>, <span class=Person>Raymond W. Kelly</span>, characterized the shooting as a hate crime.</p> <p>It is clear that the victim here was killed only because and just because he was thought to be gay, he said before delivering a commencement address in <span class=GeographicFeature>White Plains</span>. There is no question about that.</p> <p>But Mr. Moraless sister, <span class=Person>Edith Gutierrez</span>, said she did not believe he could have committed a bias crime  they have relatives who are gay, she said, and <span class=Keyword>Mr. Morales</span> had shown no signs of homophobia. She also said that when <span class=Keyword>Mr. Morales</span> telephoned her from jail on Sunday, he said he doesnt remember anything; he was under the influence, he was drinking.</p> <p>Mr. Morales, 33, said nothing at his arraignment in <span class=Organization>Manhattan Criminal Court</span> on Sunday. Judge <span class=Person>Robert Stolz</span> ordered him held without bail and scheduled another hearing for Thursday.</p> <p>The <span class=Keyword>police</span> also questioned two men who had been with <span class=Keyword>Mr. Morales</span> just before the shooting. They were questioned as witnesses, not as suspects, and were cooperating with detectives, said <span class=Person>Paul J. Browne</span>, the <span class=Organization>Police Department</span>s chief spokesman. He did not identify them.</p> <p>Mr. Morales  who had served more than 10 years in prison for a <span class=Crime>robbery</span> conviction, according to <span class=Keyword>state correction records</span>  had been staying with one of the men in <span class=City>Far Rockaway</span>, <span class=City>Queens</span>. Detectives found a second gun among Mr. Moraless belongings there, a Serbian-made Zastava that the <span class=Keyword>police</span> described as an <span class=Crime>assault</span> weapon. <span class=Keyword>Mr. Browne</span> said that sometime earlier, the man had told <span class=Keyword>Mr. Morales</span> that it made him uncomfortable to have the gun around his children.</p> <p>Mr. Carsons killing was the first in the <span class=City>West Village</span> precinct this year. In all of 2012, one homicide was reported there.</p> <p>But through the first week in May, there were 57 <span class=Crime>assault</span>s, a sharp increase over the same period last year, when there were 33. According to <span class=Keyword>police</span> statistics, the number of violent altercations is higher this year than it was a decade ago but lower than in the 1990s, when citywide crime was higher.</p> <p>Things seem a little more hostile in the Village lately, said <span class=Person>Glennda Testone</span>, the <span class=JobTitle>executive director</span> of the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and <span class=Organization>Transgender Community Center</span> on West 13th Street. People have been saying its especially on the weekends, when there is more of a commuter crowd. Perhaps what were seeing is that the growing approval of the L.G.B.T. community and the increasing equality isnt reaching to every single street.</p> <p><span class=Person>Sharon Stapel</span>, the <span class=JobTitle>executive director</span> of the <span class=Organization>New <span class=Keyword>York City Anti-Violence</span> Project</span>, said <span class=Person>antigay</span> violence had been worsened by the forces that are reshaping the city. The Village has always been a place where <span class=Keyword>L.G.B.T. people</span> have felt accepted and respected, she said, but the Village is not immune from this vitriolic anti-L.G.B.T. violence. And we are not a homogeneous community. If you talk to <span class=Keyword>young non-gender-conforming kids</span> of color, theyre going to have a very different experience than older white L.G.B.T. people.</p> <p>The <span class=Keyword>police</span> say they have moved to stem felony <span class=Crime>assault</span>s in the <span class=City>West Village</span> that can often be traced to bar fights and late-night confrontations.</p> <p>Thats why there was an impact <span class=JobTitle>officer</span> on duty there in the first place, the one who captured the shooter, said Mr. Browne, referring to <span class=JobTitle>officer</span>s assigned to areas in need of additional policing. The Village attracts crowds of visitors, especially on weekends, and impact <span class=JobTitle>officer</span>s are assigned there as a result.</p> <p>The <span class=Keyword>police</span> said that on Friday night, <span class=Keyword>Mr. Morales</span> and the two men had gone to the neighborhood and that <span class=Keyword>Mr. Morales</span> had urinated in front of the <span class=City>Annisa</span> bar and restaurant on Barrow Street at West Fourth Street. The <span class=Keyword>police</span> said he then went inside and confronted the bartender with <span class=Person>antigay</span> slurs. He yanked up his sweatshirt, showing off a revolver in a shoulder holster, and threatened to kill the bartender if he called 911, the <span class=Keyword>police</span> said.</p> <p>In the <span class=Keyword>police</span> account, <span class=Keyword>Mr. Morales</span> and his two companions left, walking along the Avenue of the <span class=Continent>Americas</span> and encountering <span class=Keyword>Mr. Carson</span> and the man he was with at West Eighth Street. Again <span class=Keyword>Mr. Morales</span> unleashed a stream of <span class=Person>antigay</span> slurs. What are you, a gay wrestler? he asked.</p> <p>Mr. Carson and his friend went on their way, and <span class=Keyword>Mr. Morales</span> pursued them, the <span class=Keyword>police</span> said. One of Mr. Moraless friends peeled off and left after failing to dissuade him from doing so, the <span class=Keyword>police</span> said.</p> <p>Hearing someone shout racial or <span class=Keyword>homophobic slurs</span> is not unusual here, said <span class=Person>Jessica Berk</span>, a neighborhood activist and lifelong resident. The victims of low-level crime  muggings, street harassment, attempted <span class=Crime>assault</span>  have traditionally been gay men, she said, adding, Its as if a memo goes out to all the muggers and troublemakers.</p> <p><span class=Person>Mark Erson</span>, the pastor at St. Johns Lutheran Church on Christopher Street, said <span class=Keyword>minutely local geography</span> had to be factored in. The shooting happened over on Sixth Avenue, so you know, you go one block over and there could be a complete change of feeling and atmosphere, he said, adding that some of the violence in the neighborhood could be drug-related. If someone strung out sees a vulnerable person, and unfortunately gay people are seen as vulnerable, one thing could lead to another.</p> <p>Mr. Carson had worked as a manager at the <span class=Company>Ciao Bella</span> gelato kiosk in <span class=Facility>Grand Central Terminal</span>. <span class=Person>Isabella Odonkor</span>, 20, worked with him there and she said he had risen quickly, because he was very good with people. If someone stopped by while he was tidying up after closing time, he would still make the sale, she said.</p> <p>She said that as far as she knew, <span class=Keyword>Mr. Carson</span> had always been open about being gay. He was not afraid of it, not afraid to share it, she said.</p> <p>She also said that he had endured occasional <span class=Person>antigay</span> slurs from customers.</p> <p>Hed always just laugh it off, she said, because he was proud of who he was.</p>","Killing in Greenwich Village Looks Like Hate Crime, Police Say - NYTimes.com",5/20/13,"Elliot Morales, Mark Carson, Paul J.

Really?  Do <span class=Keyword>teachers</span> want to teach to make big bucks? No, they do it because they are passionate about the field.  Police <span class=JobTitle>officer</span>s are the same.  You know going into it that it's not a high paying job.  If you don't like the pay or the risk you take...find another job!  <span class=StateOrCounty>Mo</span>ney doesn't make them better.  Each person is as good as they want to be.  Now, not saying that I don't respect them for what they do, I do!  <span class=StateOrCounty>Mo</span>re <span class=JobTitle>officer</span>s with more pay is not going to prevent thugs or anyone doing something they want to do!  Everyone will find a way to do what they want.</p> <p>A <span class=City>Cape</span> teacher and a <span class=City>Cape</span> <span class=Keyword>police</span> <span class=JobTitle>officer</span> start at about the same salary.  The <span class=JobTitle>officer</span> faces danger every day, has to work nights and weekends, and holidays.  Faces the possibility of danger and violence and the <span class=Keyword>constant criticism</span> that they never do anything right.  Our law enforcement <span class=JobTitle>officer</span>s are incredibly underpaid for what they have to do and face every day.  <span class=StateOrCounty>Mo</span>st <span class=Keyword>police</span> <span class=JobTitle>officer</span>s go into the job because they have a passion and they want to improve the community and help others.  Police <span class=JobTitle>officer</span>s love their job.  Teachers just bixch about their students, their pay, their co-workers.</p> <p>I have to disagree with <span class=Person>Parker</span>.  While <span class=Keyword>teachers</span> may not face the same danger and violence as <span class=Keyword>police</span> <span class=JobTitle>officer</span>s, there are times when a student does have to be restrained because they are out of control (this has happened to two of my <span class=Keyword>family members</span> who are teachers).  And don't forget about the threat of school shootings - it's the teachers' job to protect their students to the best of their ability.  And <span class=Keyword>teachers</span> do face ""constant criticism that they never do anything right"" (because little <span class=Person>Johnny</span> could never do anything wrong).  And, yes, <span class=Keyword>teachers</span> are ""incredibly underpaid for what they have to do and face very day"" (you obviously haven't been in a classroom for a long time).  And most <span class=Keyword>teachers</span> do ""go into the job because they have a passion and they want to improve the community and help others"".  I have quite a few <span class=Keyword>family members</span> who are <span class=Keyword>teachers</span> (elementary and high school) and after hearing about some of their experiences, I would much prefer manual labor over being in a classroom.</p> <p>Nice job police.  Glad to see the restraint as well.  Not sure salaries are germane to this discussion.  They kept their adrenaline in check even though most <span class=JobTitle>officer</span>s have not experienced this kind of thing before in <span class=City>Cape</span>. I am wondering if they have gone ahead and transferred the victim to a <span class=Facility>St. Louis hospital</span> yet. Is the victim stable enough?  I have no problem with the number of <span class=Keyword>police</span> on duty each night (I've been told it was 3 a few years ago), as long as they are not reluctant to patrol some of the older parts of town - I understand the argument that they don't want to stir the <span class=Organization>hornets</span> nest but as long as they are visible, then we can't ask for more.</p>","seMissourian.com: Local News: Man arrested, charged in connection with Olive Street shooting (06/05/14)",6/5/14,"Tommy Joe Davis III, Judge William Syler, Sgt.

By default, that makes juveniles prohibited people  much like felons, who cannot have guns, according to <span class=Person>Kraig Hankins</span>.</p> <p>Hankins is the chief of the <span class=Organization>Flatwoods Police Department</span> and spent <span class=Quantity>20 years</span> as a <span class=Keyword>senior special agent</span> for the <span class=Organization>Bureau of Alcohol</span>, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, or A.T.F.</p> <p>Hankins said that isnt the only <span class=FieldTerminology>federal law</span> that comes into play here.</p> <p>Under the <span class=FieldTerminology>federal law</span>, a non-licensee of one state cannot transfer a firearm to a non-licensee of another state, <span class=Keyword>Hankins</span> said.</p> <p>The man who sold the <span class=Keyword>gun</span> to the teenager lives in <span class=StateOrCounty>Ohio</span>. Because the teen lives in <span class=StateOrCounty>Kentucky</span>, selling a <span class=Keyword>gun</span> online would have been illegal even if the <span class=Keyword>boy</span> was <span class=Quantity>21 years</span> old. <span class=Keyword>Hankins</span> said sales across state lines are prohibited unless it goes through <span class=Keyword>federally licensed dealers</span> in each state.</p> <p>As an example, he said, a person in <span class=StateOrCounty>Kentucky</span> could send that firearm to a firearms licensee in <span class=StateOrCounty>West Virginia</span>, and then that person could buy the <span class=Keyword>gun</span> through that licensee. [] They cannot transfer the two firearms between each other, individually.</p> <p>However, both <span class=Keyword>Cooper</span> and <span class=Keyword>Hankins</span> noted that buying and selling guns online is legal, despite the fact that no paperwork is required and no background check is conducted, as it would typically be for <span class=Keyword>gun</span> sales. <span class=Keyword>Cooper</span> said he thinks online <span class=Keyword>gun</span> sales are a <span class=Keyword>bad idea</span> altogether.</p> <p>If you're a <span class=Keyword>gun</span> dealer to a <span class=Keyword>gun</span> dealer, sure, the Internet's a fine thing. But to people that you don't know, you just meet on <span class=Company>Facebook</span>  hell yes, it's a bad idea, <span class=Keyword>Cooper</span> said.</p> <p>He added that it allows guns to get into the hands of people who may misuse them.</p> <p>You end up with guns at schools, <span class=Keyword>Cooper</span> said. If i was going to rob a bank, you think I'd go and fill out the paperwork to buy one? Or if I was going to commit a <span class=Crime>murder</span>, do you think Id go and fill the federal paperwork out? I'd contact some fool on the Internet and say, I need a <span class=Keyword>gun</span> and I need it to protect my home.</p> <p>The A.T.F. is investigating this case and will file <span class=Keyword>federal charges</span> soon against the man who sold the gun.</p> <p>The teenager, who is a freshman at <span class=Organization>Greenup County High School</span>, was arraigned in juvenile court on Monday morning.</p> <p>Keep clicking on WSAZ.com for the latest information.</p> <p><span class=StateOrCounty>GREENUP COUNTY</span>, <span class=StateOrCounty>Ky.</span> (WSAZ)  A <span class=Keyword>high school freshman</span> is in jail after investigators say he was caught with a <span class=Keyword>gun</span> at <span class=Organization>Greenup County High School</span> before the schools homecoming <span class=Sport>football</span> game Friday night.</p> <p>Greenup County <span class=Person>Sheriff Keith Cooper</span> said it happened about 5 p.m. and that the boy, who is <span class=Quantity>15 years</span> old, raised his shirt and flashed the weapon to a group of <span class=Sport>football</span> players, who told their coach. <span class=Keyword>School officials</span> separated him from the other students and called deputies, who questioned the <span class=Keyword>boy</span> about why he had a <span class=Quantity>9-millimeter</span> semiautomatic handgun with him.</p> <p>Fully loaded, with a clip in it, extra clip in his pocket and a box of shells in his backpack, <span class=Keyword>Cooper</span> said. Told them, yeah, he did bring the <span class=Keyword>gun</span> with him, didn't intend on using it or have any real plans for it, he just wanted to be cool.</p> <p><span class=Person>Jason Blevins</span> lives about two blocks from the school and has two teenage daughters. He found out about the incident through a text message alert and voicemail from the school <span class=JobTitle>superintendent</span>.</p> <p>My first thought was that my daughter was at the <span class=Sport>football</span> game, Blevins said. She was there on the campus when it happened, so I was just really glad that nothing happened.</p> <p>The student did not fire any shots, according to Sheriff Cooper, who said while the <span class=Keyword>gun</span> was loaded, the bullets were not in the chamber. No one was hurt.</p> <p>Kind of scary in a way, because you never know what somebody might do  even if they say they're not intending to shoot it or something like that. You never know what's going to happen, Blevins said.</p> <p>Cooper said the student told them he bought the <span class=Keyword>gun</span> on the Internet.</p> <p>If we can find out who it was that met a <span class=Quantity>15-year</span>-old <span class=Keyword>boy</span> and sold him a handgun, we're going to want to, us and the <span class=Organization>ATF</span> are both going to want to talk to them, <span class=Keyword>Cooper</span> said.</p> <p>He cautioned parents that while <span class=Keyword>high school students</span> may think they are adults, they are still children.</p> <p>There's nothing cool about taking a <span class=Keyword>gun</span> with you to school or to a function, <span class=Keyword>Cooper</span> said. Guns have their place and I'm a big proponent of them, but not for children.</p> <p>Cooper added, He's a <span class=Keyword>boy</span> but he's facing a man's charges here, and it'll be up to the court system to see what happens to him.</p> <p>The student has been charged with carrying a <span class=Keyword>gun</span> on school grounds, which is a Class D felony punishable by up to a year in prison. He is also facing a charge of carrying a concealed weapon. He is currently at the <span class=Facility>Boyd County Detention Center</span>, which <span class=Keyword>Cooper</span> says is the closest facility approved for juveniles.</p> <p>Keep clicking on WSAZ.com for the latest information.</p> <p>ORIGINAL STORY 10/11/13 <span class=TwitterHandle>@</span> 8:45 p.m.</p> <p><span class=StateOrCounty>GREENUP COUNTY</span>, <span class=StateOrCounty>Ky.</span> (WSAZ) -- A <span class=Quantity>15-year</span>-old <span class=Organization>Greenup County High School</span> student was arrested Friday after Greenup County Sheriff's deputies say he was caught with a <span class=Keyword>gun</span> on school grounds, according to the sheriff.</p> <p>It happened about 5 p.m. Friday.</p> <p>No one was hurt.</p> <p>The sheriff said the student was arrested and is charged with carrying a concealed weapon.</p> <p>More charges are pending.</p> <p>School officials say they will prosecute to the fullest extent in this case.</p> <p>Keep clicking on WSAZ.com for the latest information.</p>",Authorities Consider Charges Against Man Who Sold Gun to Teen,10/15/13,"Sheriff Keith Cooper, Kraig Hankins, Jason Blevins",Portsmouth,"GREENUP COUNTY, Ky., Kentucky, Ohio, West Virginia",,,on,KY,,,,,,,,,,,,Greenup County,10/15/13,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6pm,evening,9mm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

""The <span class=City>Norfolk</span> <span class=Organization>Sheriff's Office</span> considers this a very serious and unacceptable situation and has taken immediate and <span class=Keyword>appropriate disciplinary action</span> against the deputy.""</p> <p>The gun was recovered in the dressing room, said <span class=Person>Paula Miller</span>, a <span class=Organization>Sheriff's Office</span> spokeswoman. The deputy's name was not released. Police often carry their duty weapons when they are off-duty.</p> <p>COMMENTS ADVISORY: Users are solely responsible for opinions they post here; comments do not reflect the views of The Virginian-Pilot or its websites.

Read the full rules here.</p> <p>Cleaning their guns at the time, but there was the man who accidentally shot a child, his downstairs neighbor in <span class=City>Virginia Beach</span> in the recent past. And the man last summer who accidentally shot his own son last summer in <span class=City>Norfolk</span>. And the man who accidentally shot and killed his own son when leaving a gun show in <span class=StateOrCounty>PA</span> around the holidays. I may be wrong, but I believe that in every one of these shootings, the trained handler thought the gun was empty. It happens frequently.</p> <p>last night on the 10 o'clock news the local <span class=Person>Fox</span> stationwas going crazy over this ""major event"" with interviews of Concerned Shoppers, interactive mpas and aerial photos, and ""late breaking"" headlines. Of course, there's nothing to the story; a guy made a mistake.  Yes, a serious mistake, but it doesn't rise to the level of news.</p> <p>This story by the newspaper is, however, worhty to run if nothing else, but to put out the fire from the sensationalist TV news. And the headline and lede tells the story correctly, not the bait-and switch like <span class=Person>Fox</span> did.</p> <p>Either <span class=Person>Fox</span> didn't check the facts like it should (poor journalism) or it did, and didn't care (even worse).</p> <p>""They should only carry guns when they are transporting prisoners"". I wasn't spewing falsehoods. I didn't call all gun carriers idiots, I did not say that all idiots are GRANTED concealed weapons permits, and I really don't care whether they're valid everywhere. I was just pointing out that the ease of access by random idiots. If some of you feel that term applies to you, then please check to be absolutely sure your safety is on. I'm not anti-gun, but I do totally support common sense.</p> <p>I must question the level of education of anyone making a statement about <span class=Keyword>gun control</span> in response to this article.. Our constitution was written by men capable of high level conceptualization. They saw all men are created equal. Money and politics created slavery, opression of women, etc. <span class=Person>Sam Colt</span> leveled the playing field with a revolver.  Now, the modern musket is the <span class=StateOrCounty>AR</span>. Everyone is entitled to one (and ammo) by law, accept it or leave the <span class=Country>US</span>.</p> <p>If your willing to call all Americans idiots, that would indicate you also see little to no value in Americans in general. Is this why people can so callously support the murdering of babies. For those babies are random citizens as well, but you would call them idiots as well, right?</p> <p>This is another example of <span class=Keyword>lib hate</span> to further their agenda. Hate and name call. First time I have seen a lib call all of us, to include himself an idiot to make a point. Very strange lib logic. But hey, if it moves the agenda along, a lib calling a lib an idiot is acceptable as well.</p> <p>Cost has nothing to do with it PO.  If a <span class=StateOrCounty>Chesapeake Sheriff</span>'s Deputy is in <span class=City>Alexandria</span> on personal business, and he witnesses a crime, he has the authority, and a duty to make an arrest.  The point is, he has the jurisdiction.  Nobody is saying they should run up there and set up a sting - just pointing out that contrary to what people think, and have posted, a Sheriff's Deputy is in fact a fully empowered <span class=Company>LEO</span>.</p> <p>Second- Yes, when you dial 911 the police <span class=JobTitle>officer</span> that responds to you will be armed. The reason for his weapon though is for his protection, not yours. The same goes for <span class=Keyword>deputy</span> sheriffs carrying weapons. It is for their protection. Police <span class=JobTitle>officer</span>s usually deal with a suspect for about an hour before handing them over to the jail, but deputies deal with the same people for sometimes months even before going to court. Who do you think the criminal is going to remember upon release? the <span class=JobTitle>officer</span> that spent an hour with him <span class=Quantity>9 months</span> ago or the <span class=Keyword>deputy</span> that the criminal feels stripped their freedoms away for <span class=Quantity>9 months</span>?</p> <p>decide what stories we can comment on. This story is about a <span class=FieldTerminology>law enforcement</span> <span class=JobTitle>officer</span> making a dumb but human mistake. It never should have happened but it's a human. The story about the <span class=Organization>NRA</span> making a <span class=Keyword>logical thought process</span> and saying training someone at our schools is one of the smartest ways to protect our children we can't comment on. The capture of two people in the <span class=Crime>arson</span> investigation on the <span class=Region>Eastern Shore</span> is another we are unable to comment on.</p> <p>You only got <span class=Quantity>3 months</span> of moderated status.  I've been on <span class=Keyword>moderated status</span> for the past three plus years and likely will always have my comments reviewed before being posted.  In fact it will be a miricle if this comment sees the light of day.  When I asked the Pilot why the the moderator said it was because I used the offensive term ""anchor baby"" when commenting on a story about undocumented ""visitors"" to the <span class=Country>US</span>.  I don't see what the problem is with that term since it's used in major papers across the <span class=Country>US</span> including the <span class=PrintMedia>New York Times</span> and <span class=PrintMedia>LA Times</span>.</p> <p>Typical liberal mentality...Create a <span class=Keyword>new law</span> or bureaucracy to correct a simple problem.  Before long these idiots will propose a <span class=Keyword>new law</span> to require <span class=Keyword>dressing room</span> monitors in each <span class=Keyword>dressing room</span> in every store in the state.  We will have an <span class=Organization>Virginia Department of Dressing Room</span> Monitoring to provide administrators, training, and policies for the new monitors.  In order to pay for the <span class=Organization>new Department</span>, the <span class=Keyword>dressing rooms</span> will be equipped with meters to accept payment from each person as they change clothes.  The Department will also provide for meter police to collect and give fines to those that don't properly feed the meter.  God forbid if you accidentally leave your underwear in the room....Then they have to call the <span class=Organization>Dept. of Health</span>.</p> <p>Seems to me the news has their news in the wrong order, which is more serious? a <span class=Organization>Rutgers</span> coach pushing his players around. Or a <span class=Keyword>dumb sheriff</span> leaving a gun in a store then covering up his name. What if a person got hold of said gun & hurt some one, I guess all would be forgiven too. It seems to me he is more dangerous than <span class=Person>Barney Fiffe</span> on <span class=Person>Andy Griffet</span>. He shouldn't be alowed to have a gun with ""1"" bullet at all. I guess they took lessons from the Vatican on how to cover up a very big mistake.</p>",Norfolk deputy leaves gun in Macy's dressing room | HamptonRoads.com | PilotOnline.com,4/3/13,"Fox, Paula Miller, Sam Colt, Barney Fiffe, Andy Griffet","Norfolk, Virginia Beach, Alexandria","Chesapeake Sheriff, PA, AR",,,on,VA,,,,,,,,,,,,Norfolk,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,unknown,unknown,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Im a law abiding citizen. I dont try to break the law or anything. So theres no reason why anyone would take a shot at me that I know of.</p> <p>But apparently, someone did shoot at Sparks as he was driving to his job at a <span class=Keyword>Christian publishing house</span> Friday morning.</p> <p>It was like my windshield exploded, Sparks said. And I noticed there was a hole in it so I looked, or felt, because there was <span class=Keyword>immediate pain</span> in this area.</p> <p>Sparks said the bullet entered just below his neck and lodged below his shoulder.</p> <p>If it had struck him a few inches in the other direction, Oh, Id be dead, Sparks said. Id be dead. Its the grace of God.</p> <p>Police said this seems to be an isolated incident, but they have few clues to go on right now. They did find some shell casings, but they may have been too far away to have been fired from the gun that shot at Sparks.</p> <p>Chances are they didnt have anything to do with this case, but they collected them anyway because they were somewhat close to the area, said <span class=Person>Cpl. Tracey Knight</span> with the <span class=Organization>Fort Worth Police Department</span>. So, we could use the publics assistance on this one.</p> <p>I wanted to go to work, thats all I wanted to do, Sparks said.</p> <p>Baffled by why anyone would want to shoot at passing cars, Sparks said he knows what he would tell the gunman.</p> <p>What would I say? He needs to get Christ, Sparks said. He needs to get Christ. Violence isnt the answer.

There are <span class=Keyword>people</span> out there who say we need to reexamine our countrys firearm policies, and still others who believe <span class=Keyword>American citizens</span> shouldnt be allowed to own <span class=Keyword>guns</span> at all. To these critics, I pose just one question: Without guns, how am I supposed to protect myself from my immediate family?</p> <p>If I lose my gun rights, I lose my right to self-defense against those who live closest to me, right here in my own homemy wife and three children.</p> <p>Ive heard all the arguments. Guns are dangerous. Guns are evil. Guns kill thousands of innocent <span class=Keyword>people</span> across the world every year. But the last time I checked, there are four <span class=Keyword>individuals</span> living under my roof who have more or less <span class=Keyword>unfettered access</span> to my property and person at all times. They even have keys to the place.</p> <p>So what happens if my wife or one of my kids, ages 7 to 16, decides to <span class=Person>rob</span> me? Or attack me? If Im not carrying a gun, my options are pretty limited. The truth is, there are always going to be demented <span class=Keyword>individuals</span> in my family who are willing to do God knows what <span class=Keyword>terrible things</span> to hurt people. We cant change that. But with firearms, we can protect ourselves against threats within the home.</p> <p>Its my house, and if a <span class=Keyword>suspicious family member</span> wandering the <span class=Keyword>hallways</span> suddenly threatens me, I have the right to fight back using everything up to and including deadly force.</p> <p>This could be life or death were talking about here. There are crazy, desperate <span class=Keyword>people</span> out there in my kitchen, my living roomeverywhere. I even ride in cars with these people. For Christs sake, my <span class=Quantity>13-year</span>-old, <span class=Person>Nathan</span>, sleeps in the room right next to mine, his head just a few feet away from my own! Without a gun, Id be left powerless and fully exposed.</p> <p>Thats why I keep a <span class=Person>Smith</span> & Wesson 642 <span class=Company>Hammerless</span> strapped to my calf at all times.</p> <p>Suppose I wake up in the middle of the night, hear noises coming from downstairs, go to check it out, and run into my teenage daughter, surprising her. Suppose a confrontation ensues. Suppose it escalates and gets out of control. In such encounters, its every citizens right to protect himself by gunning down a blood relative.</p> <p>Even as I sit here writing this column in my study, those <span class=Keyword>nutjob members</span> of my household could break in from the next room and come right at me. Do you think the <span class=Keyword>police</span> would arrive before I was completely surrounded by my family? Of course not.</p> <p>Im the only <span class=Keyword>police</span> around here. Im the one who sits across from his wife and <span class=Keyword>kids</span> at the <span class=Keyword>dining room table</span> with a loaded shotgun on his lap.</p> <p>You see, those gun-control <span class=Keyword>people</span> in <span class=City>Washington</span> dont know what its like to live here, and so they just dont get it. If they take away my guns, the other members of the <span class=Person>Lewis</span> family will still be out theremaybe on the couch watching television, maybe out in the garage, maybe around the next cornerand Ill have no overwhelming, <span class=Keyword>lethal force</span> to protect myself with.</p> <p>Still, the <span class=Keyword>anti-gun crowd</span> thinks its wrong for me to own an <span class=Keyword>extensive collection</span> of semiautomatic <span class=FieldTerminology>assault rifles</span>. But then they p<span class=Person>rob</span>ably also think it was wrong of me to shoot that son of mine I saw trying to break into my car last year.</p>","Without Guns, How Am I Supposed To Defend Myself From My Family? - The Onion",7/23/13,"rob, Lewis, Nathan, Smith",Washington,Empty,,,,,on,,on,,,on,,,,,,,2012,1,,1,Home,,,,,unknown,male,Sean Lewis,white,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,unknown,unknown,Semi-automatic Assault Rifle,,,,,,,,unknown,male,unknown,unknown,unknown,Unknown,white,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As part of its ""Defend Liberty Gun Giveaway,"" one lucky donor to the former <span class=StateOrCounty>Texas</span><span class=JobTitle>congressman</span>'s organization, Campaign for Liberty, will receive a DDM4 AR-15. But Paul isn't alone. More than a dozen candidates for national and local office have offered up free firearms to their supporters during the 2014 election cycle, with gifts ranging from pistols to shotguns to an <span class=Keyword>AR-15</span> customized by the gubernatorial <span class=Keyword>candidate</span> himself. It's the year's hottest conservative campaign gimmick.</p> <p>While candidates may be exploiting right-wing fears of an impending <span class=Person>Obama</span> firearm confiscation, the phenomenon isn't new. The tactic traces backto at least 1994not coincidentally the last time fears of a gun-grabbing Democratic president reached a fever pitch. Surprise: All the gun-giving candidates are Republicans. Historically, these gun giveaways haven't been terribly successful. With the exception of three incumbent politicians, none of the candidates who have tried to entice voters with firearmshave ever gone on to win their races.</p> <p>Here's a quick history:</p> <p><span class=Person>Rep.

This morning, the surviving members of the <span class=Keyword>Yellow Dogs</span>  Siavash <span class=Person>Obash</span> <span class=Person>Karampour</span> and <span class=Person>Koory Mirzeai</span>  released an <span class=JobTitle>official</span> statement with the help of their manager <span class=Person><span class=Person>Ali</span> Salehezadeh</span>, <span class=Keyword>street artists Icy</span> And Sot, and their friend <span class=Person>Pooya Hosseini</span>, a member of the band, the <span class=Company>Free Keys</span>, that the shooter had been kicked out of.</p> <p>We will not let this <span class=Keyword>disgusting brutality</span> define us or become our story, <span class=Person>Obash</span> and Koory write, but instead respond by creating music more passionately and with more intensity than ever before, embracing the freedom that we all dreamed would <span class=Quantity>one day</span> be ours back in <span class=Country>Iran</span> and play to honor those who should be playing next to us.</p> <p>Details about a <span class=Keyword>memorial service</span> and benefit are forthcoming. In the meantime, read the full statement below.</p> <p>We want to extend our deepest and most sincere thanks for the overwhelming support, love and encouragement weve been shown over the past few days, in the wake of such an incredible loss. We would like to express our <span class=Keyword>deepest condolences</span> to the families of <span class=Person><span class=City>Soroush</span></span> and <span class=Person>Arash Farazmand</span> and <span class=Person><span class=Person>Ali</span> Eskandarian</span>, and will together share our sorrow.</p> <p>Yellow Dogs and <span class=Company>Free Keys</span> met in <span class=Country>Iran</span> in 2006 with a shared vision of building a strong artistic and creative community. With all of the limitations that we faced there, we still found a way to express ourselves and create art that we believed in. We built an underground venue together so we could play shows, and forged strong bonds of friendship, love and support.</p> <p>Yellow Dogs came to <span class=Continent>America</span> in January 2010, and <span class=Company>Free Keys</span> joined in December 2011, with Icy and Sot arriving a year later, bringing our <span class=Keyword>close-knit community</span> together in <span class=Continent>America</span>. Shortly after the <span class=Keyword>Yellow Dogs</span> arrived in <span class=City>New York</span>, we met <span class=Person><span class=Person>Ali</span> Salehezadeh</span>, our manager, and a few months later, fellow musician/author <span class=Person><span class=Person>Ali</span> Eskandarian</span>  the group of us connected immediately, forming an instant bond. We rented a house together in <span class=City>Brooklyn</span>, a refuge where we could pursue our dreams and make music together. Since that point almost <span class=Quantity>four years</span> ago, weve lived together, worked together, created together and fulfilled some of our wildest dreams together.</p> <p>The transition between <span class=City>Tehran</span> and <span class=City>New York</span> was not without difficulties for <span class=Company>Free Keys</span>, whose bass player was unable to secure a visa in <span class=Country>Iran</span>. With shows already scheduled in <span class=City>New York</span>, the band recruited a new member, <span class=Person>Ali</span> Akbar Mohammadi <span class=Person>Rafi</span>e <span class=Person>Rafi</span>, before coming to the States. By the third show in May 2012, <span class=Company>Free Keys</span> decided to stop working with <span class=Person>Rafi</span> as a result of personal and musical differences. It became clear very quickly that he was not a natural fit within our group of friends, and his personal views conflicted with our approach to our art and to the world.</p> <p>A few months later, both bands severed ties completely with <span class=Person>Rafi</span> and in the <span class=Quantity>14 months</span> since then, weve had no contact with him at all. <span class=Company>Free Keys</span> enlisted new members and started to move in a new direction artistically, a decision that allowed <span class=Keyword>drummer Arash</span> to join his brother <span class=Person><span class=City>Soroush</span></span> to play drums in the Yellow Dogs. With both bands lineups complete, we were excited about continuing to work and create music together.</p> <p>All of that ended Sunday night. Before committing suicide, <span class=Person>Rafi</span> shot and killed our guitar player and drummer, brothers <span class=Person><span class=City>Soroush</span></span> and <span class=Person>Arash Farazmand</span>, and our roommate and dear friend, <span class=Person><span class=Person>Ali</span> Eskandarian</span>, who was also a <span class=Keyword>frequent guest vocalist</span> for our band. <span class=Quantity>Three days</span> later, were still here, still breathing but with a gaping hole in our hearts. For now its impossible to even imagine a future without our friends, and no explanation can make sense or begin to justify what has happened to our lives. To say we are heartbroken does not come close. These are the darkest hours of our lives, we are in shock, awe, blinded with rage and paralyzed with grief. <span class=Person><span class=Person>Ali</span> Eskandarian</span> was nearly finished with his memoir, Arash had just received <span class=FieldTerminology>political asylum</span> from <span class=Country>Iran</span> and <span class=Person><span class=City>Soroush</span></span> was hard at work on new <span class=Keyword>Yellow Dogs</span> material. Everything we had hoped and worked for was finally coming truethe future was so incredibly bright.</p> <p>In the aftermath of these horrific events, we are left with pain, emptiness and so many questions that wont ever be answered. We wanted the world to discover us as we were: a community of musicians defined by our music, our friendships, our culture and our art. This is not the way we ever imagined the world would learn of our story.</p> <p>As we face the greatest sorrow weve ever experienced, were left with something that no one could ever take away from us  beautiful memories of our fallen brothers, friends who we love and so desperately miss. We will not forget the dreams we shared and this life that we built together  its stronger, more permanent, more real and more full of life than any senseless, evil act could ever begin to take away from us. We will not let this <span class=Keyword>disgusting brutality</span> define us or become our story, but instead respond by creating music more passionately and with more intensity than ever before, embracing the freedom that we all dreamed would <span class=Quantity>one day</span> be ours back in <span class=Country>Iran</span> and play to honor those who should be playing next to us. That is who we are, and that is what we stand for, and we will strive to honor the lives of <span class=Person>Ali</span>, Arash and <span class=Person><span class=City>Soroush</span></span> for the rest of ours.</p> <p>We are currently planning a <span class=Keyword>memorial service</span> for <span class=Person>Ali</span>, Arash and <span class=Person><span class=City>Soroush</span></span>, and will announce more details shortly. We are also organizing a benefit to help with the costs incurred by this tragedy. We would greatly appreciate if the privacy of our friends and family is respected during this difficult time.

Police said their wounds were not life-threatening.</p> <p>""We know that the teens weren't in the club, but they told police they were in the area to meet women,"" said <span class=Person>Capt. Stephen Basting</span> of <span class=City>Milwaukee</span> Police District 1.</p> <p>Officers were already near the club, knowing that a <span class=Keyword>popular act</span> was scheduled to perform, and investigators are trying to determine what led to the shooting.</p> <p>""There may have been been some altercation last night or prior to this. Very rarely do you have someone firing rounds randomly, particularly downtown,"" Basting said.</p> <p>In June, a group of men who had just left the <span class=Keyword>club</span> began fighting in a parking lot. One of the men then went to a car, picked up a gun and started shooting.</p> <p>In November, the <span class=Organization>Common Council</span>'s <span class=Keyword>Licenses Committee</span> approved renewing the club's tavern and <span class=Keyword>public entertainment licenses</span> but also agreed to send a <span class=Keyword>warning letter</span> after hearing complaints about loud and <span class=Keyword>disruptive crowding</span> at the <span class=Organization>480-capacity club</span>.</p> <p>During the hearing, an <span class=JobTitle>attorney</span> for licensee <span class=Person>Habib Manjee</span> said records showed that police were called to the <span class=Keyword>club</span> 18 times in 2009, compared with one time in 2012.</p> <p>Basting said the club's management and ownership has worked well with police.</p> <p>""Despite all that, there's a tendency for disruption, when you have 400 people and, of course, everybody leaves at the same time,"" he said.</p> <p>Overall, the captain said, downtown remains a very safe part of the city. He estimated that more than 100,000 people came <span class=Keyword>downtown Wednesday</span> and Thursday, a higher number than usual for the entertainment district, thanks to holiday fireworks and Summerfest.</p> <p>""It's unfortunate that this happens. My hope is that we keep it in perspective,"" he said.</p> <p>The <span class=Keyword>shooting downtown</span> was not the only outbreak of gunfire in the city Thursday night.</p> <p>A <span class=Quantity>22-year</span>-old was shot in the legs about 5:30 p.m. Thursday at <span class=Keyword>N. 40th St.</span> and W. Concordia Ave. Police suspect the shooting stemmed from an argument.</p> <p>A shooting just before 10:30 p.m. critically wounded a <span class=Quantity>25-year</span>-old <span class=City>Milwaukee</span> resident in the 4300 block of <span class=Keyword>N. 30th St.</span> The motive and gunman's identity are unknown.</p> <p>About the same time, officers responded to reports of shots fired near <span class=Keyword>N. 49th St.</span> and <span class=Keyword>W. Hampton Ave.</span> and found two <span class=City>Milwaukee</span> residents had been shot. A third arrived at a hospital separately.</p> <p>About midnight, a <span class=Quantity>20-year</span>-old was found shot in the torso in the 3000 block of <span class=Keyword>N. 9th St.</span> and remained in critical condition Friday.</p> <p>Anyone with information about the shootings is asked to call police at (414) 935-7360.</p> <p>Last year, from July 3 to 5, six <span class=Keyword>nonfatal shootings</span> were reported in <span class=City>Milwaukee</span>.

More than 100 of the 1,600 exhibitors are new, and SHOT, the Shooting Hunting and Outdoor Trade Show has more than 400 companies on its wait list.</p> <p>From Jan. 14-17, 61,000 preregistered attendees are set to walk the floor, up 19 percent from 2013. <span class=Keyword>Qualified-buyer attendance a0lso</span> is up 28 percent to 27,000 people.</p> <p>I think that really speaks to the quality of the event and the enthusiasm and the passion for our industry and for hunting and shooting, said <span class=Person>Chris Dolnack</span>, <span class=JobTitle>senior vice president and chief marketing officer</span> for the <span class=Organization>National Shooting Sports Foundation</span>.</p> <p>SHOT is owned by the <span class=Organization>National Shooting Sports Foundation</span>, the trade association for the $6 billion <span class=Keyword>firearms industry</span> that supports more than 245,000 jobs.</p> <p>Some of the increases are part of the trade show churn, the ebb and flow of people who dont attend every year. But the shows also seeing increases because the <span class=Keyword>firearms market</span> was particularly strong last year.</p> <p>Theres no question there was record sales both from a manufacturing and retail side, <span class=Keyword>Dolnack</span> said.</p> <p>As one industry example, <span class=Person>Sturm</span>, <span class=Company>Ruger &Co</span>. <span class=Person>CEO Michael Fifer</span> said his company had a backlog of 2 million firearms on order when it released its <span class=Keyword>latest earnings report</span> in November. The companys third-quarter sales in 2013 were s$171 million, up 45 percent from third quarter 2012.</p> <p>Weve been a bright spot in the economy the last couple of years, <span class=Keyword>Dolnack</span> said.</p> <p>New to the show this year is Henderson-based ConvExx, which was hired in <span class=City>mid-2013</span> as the shows management partner, replacing <span class=Person>Reed</span> Exhibitions, a company that managed <span class=Keyword>SHOT</span> for more than 30 years. In May the foundations contract with <span class=Person>Reed</span> was terminated after <span class=Person>Reed</span> restricted the sale of certain types of firearms at a consumer hunting and fishing show in 2013.</p> <p>Were very pleased with ConvExx, <span class=Keyword>Dolnack</span> said.</p> <p>ConvExxs <span class=JobTitle>executive</span> show manager for SHOT, <span class=Person>Jeff Pressman</span>, said everything went off without a hitch this year, although when the company took over the show already was fully booked.</p> <p>Obviously because were based here in <span class=City>Las <span class=Person>Vegas</span></span>, we see the value in this not only for our company but also to the city, Pressman said.</p> <p>ConvExx focused on ensuring the attendees are of a certain caliber, something the company did through more <span class=Keyword>stringent qualification methods</span> than in years past.</p> <p>Because of the management change, all of the shows vendor contracts that previously were with <span class=Person>Reed</span> are now with the foundation. One of those is with <span class=Person>Freeman</span>, which handles exhibitor move-in and move-out.</p> <p>Trending this year is self-defense and concealed carry, while female participation in both self-defense and target shooting has seen large increases. As a result, manufacturers are making more products for women, including holsters designed for a womans frame. Youth products are already ticking up, <span class=Keyword>Dolnack</span> said.</p> <p>For ammunition, theres now more availability on retail shelves as the market has reached saturation.</p> <p>If you ran across it and you like to go shooting, then you bought it, <span class=Keyword>Dolnack</span> said. But you can only have so much invested in ammunition.</p> <p>SHOT is contracted with <span class=Keyword>Sands Expo</span> and <span class=Organization><span class=Facility>Convention Center</span></span> through 2018, and the show brings an estimated economic impact of $73 million to <span class=City>Las <span class=Person>Vegas</span></span>, the foundation reports.</p> <p>Our attendees like coming here, and they spend money, <span class=Keyword>Dolnack</span> said. <span class=Person>Vegas</span> is really the best convention city, certainly in America, if not the world.</p> <p>The <span class=City>Las <span class=Person>Vegas</span></span> Convention and Visitors Authority is a silver sponsor of the show. And later this year, representatives from the foundation and the travel board will travel to the <span class=Organization>IWA</span> Show, an <span class=Keyword>international weapons expo</span> in <span class=Country>Germany</span>.</p> <p>Its the <span class=Keyword>SHOT</span> Show of <span class=Continent>Europe</span>, <span class=Keyword>Dolnack</span> said.</p> <p>The foundation plans to exhibit in the shows American pavilion, where it will work to increase SHOTs international attendance by 20 percent.</p> <p>American firearms and accessories have a tremendous cachet around the world, <span class=Keyword>Dolnack</span> said of the segments possibility.</p> <p>A top priority for the foundation is fixing NICS, the National Instant <span class=Keyword>Criminal Background Check</span> System.</p> <p>Its frustrating, to say the least, that <span class=Keyword>mental health records</span> are not in the system, even though, going back as far as the <span class=Organization>Clinton administration</span>, millions of dollars were allocated in grants to local police and <span class=FieldTerminology>law enforcement</span> agencies to enter those records. Theres a big gap there, <span class=Keyword>Dolnack</span> said.</p> <p>The foundation also is working to return federal funding to Project Child Safe, which has distributed more than 36 million <span class=Keyword>free gun safety</span> kits in the <span class=Country>United States</span>.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the trade show is battling suitcasing, which happens when companies walk around and show off their products without buying exhibit space.</p> <p>Really, theyre drawing on the equity that others have created, <span class=Keyword>Dolnack</span> said. Frankly its a form of pirating.</p> <p><span class=Person>Outboarding</span>, too, is an issue, and the foundation already has shut down one operator this week.</p> <p><span class=Person>Outboarding</span> is when would-be exhibitors instead host private meetings in a hotel suite or anywhere off the show floor, taking buyers out of the trade show. During last weeks International CES, outboarding was rampant with companies such as <span class=Company>Netgear</span> taking meetings in hotel suites.</p> <p>We take that very seriously. We want to protect our exhibitors and the significant investment the foundation has made in the show and conference, <span class=Keyword>Dolnack</span> said.</p> <p>SHOT Show also features educational programs for retailers, buyers and <span class=FieldTerminology>law enforcement</span>.</p> <p>One of the shows newest sponsors is the <span class=Organization>Georgia Economic Development Council</span>, which made a three-year commitment to the event.</p> <p>Theyre actively looking to help companies relocate to a more friendly firearms climate, <span class=Keyword>Dolnack</span> said.</p> <p>Relocating has apparently been on companys minds. Erie, Colo.-based <span class=Company>Magpul Industries</span>, for example, announced earlier this month that it was moving to Wyoming and Texas after the Colorado Legislature passed a measure banning weapons magazines with more than 15 rounds.</p> <p>Dolnack said he doesnt know of any companies specifically looking to move to <span class=StateOrCounty>Nevada</span>, although it does have a favorable climate for the industry.</p> <p>Contact <span class=JobTitle>reporter</span> <span class=Person>Laura Carroll</span> at lcarroll@reviewjournal.com or 702-380-4588.

She was hospitalized with a wound to her hand.</p> <p>Police said a shot was fired at a fourth victim who pursued the shooter from the scene, but the person was uninjured. Two other people also were taken from the scene to a hospital with <span class=Keyword>unspecified medical issues</span> related to the shooting.</p> <p><span class=Person>Rich Robertson</span>, a private investigator, received a phone call from <span class=City>Hummels</span> at 8:30 a.m. MST Wednesday.</p> <p><span class=City>Hummels</span> wanted a favor. He was calling to ask Robertson to assist one of <span class=City>Hummels</span>' former clients, one that he had given free legal aid. <span class=City>Hummels</span> was concerned the person needed more help, Robertson said.</p> <p>""Mark was always willing to help,"" Robertson said. Among the causes he gave time to was the nonprofit <span class=StateOrCounty>Arizona</span> Justice Project, a group that helps inmates try to overturn wrongful convictions.</p> <p>Although <span class=City>Hummels</span> had been a lawyer for less than 10 years, he already was the Phoenix chapter of the <span class=Organization>Federal Bar Association</span>, had spent hundreds of hours providing <span class=Keyword>free legal aid</span> and had gained the respect of many of the state's most prominent lawyers.</p> <p>At 9:30 a.m., <span class=City>Hummels</span> was representing Singer, the <span class=JobTitle>chief executive</span> of a call-center company, at an <span class=Keyword>arbitration meeting</span> at a <span class=Keyword>north-central Phoenix</span> law office. Singer was the defendant in a lawsuit. After the meeting broke up an hour later, both men were shot in front of the building.</p> <p>Authorities said Harmon used a <span class=City>Springfield</span> 1911 .45-caliber pistol and a Ruger .22-caliber pistol in the office shooting, and fired a 1970s vintage Colt AR15 rifle on a motorist who followed him in the aftermath.</p> <p>According to court records, Singer had hired Harmon's firm almost a year ago to refurbish and move office furniture at the <span class=City>Santa Maria</span>, Calif., offices of his call center, <span class=Company>Fusion Contact Center LLC</span>.</p> <p>The contract was for $47,000, but a dispute erupted because not all of the work could be completed. The parties traded lengthy emails. In April, after receiving $30,000, <span class=Keyword>court records</span> say, Harmon filed suit.</p> <p>As the legal case dragged on, <span class=Keyword>court records</span> say Harmon engaged in financial transactions with a son, Stefan Harmon. Legal filings allege that <span class=Keyword>Arthur Harmon</span> sold his home, valued at $100,000, to the son for $26,000, then borrowed $180,000 from another party using the home he no longer owned as collateral. The filings say that money then was loaned to Stefan Harmon.</p> <p>Fusion countersued, alleging that Arthur Harmon, who had no <span class=JobTitle>legal counsel</span>, was overpaid and fraudulently transferred property in connection with the litigation. The company sought a payment of $20,184 from Harmon to end the case. Harmon testified his savings totaled $17.</p> <p>Mediation proceedings were set up to address continuing issues in the case.</p> <p>Praise and respect for <span class=City>Hummels</span> came from every corner, from those who knew him in <span class=StateOrCounty>Arizona</span> legal circles to those who remembered him fondly from years before.</p> <p>""He wasn't full of bluster. He would go out of his way for people,"" Robertson said.</p> <p><span class=City>Hummels</span> worked as a journalist before becoming a lawyer. After receiving a bachelor's degree from <span class=Organization>Colorado College</span>, <span class=City>Hummels</span> earned a master's degree in journalism from the <span class=Organization>University of California-Berkeley</span> in 1997. His first job was as a reporting intern at the <span class=City>Santa Fe</span> New Mexican.</p> <p>""The best thing about Mark was his attitude. He was a serious journalist but made what we do fun,"" said <span class=Person>Steve Terrell</span>, a reporter with the paper. He and <span class=City>Hummels</span> covered the New Mexico Capitol beat together. ""When he became an attorney, we all teased Mark about how serious he looked in his work photo. We have a picture from his going-away party when he was wearing a Hawaiian shirt, smoking a fake cigar and crossing his eyes.""</p> <p><span class=City>Hummels</span> left the New Mexican in 2001 to attend law school at the University of <span class=StateOrCounty>Arizona</span>. He graduated summa cum laude in 2004 and earned the highest score on the <span class=StateOrCounty>Arizona</span> Bar exam that year.</p> <p><span class=Person>Judge Andrew Hurwitz</span> of the 9th <span class=Organization>U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals</span> gave <span class=City>Hummels</span> a job as a clerk when Hurwitz served on the <span class=StateOrCounty>Arizona</span> Supreme Court in 2004.</p> <p>He said that he and <span class=City>Hummels</span> ""became fast and dear friends.""</p> <p>""This is a day of unspeakable sorrow,"" he said.

Cumpston/Wikimedia Commons FMK 91C, the Bill of Rights Pistol.</p> <p>The severely mentally ill have easy access to guns in <span class=StateOrCounty>Oklahoma</span>, The <span class=StateOrCounty>Oklahoma</span>n reported yesterday. Gerald David Hume, a diagnosed schizophrenic, was able to purchase rifles and a handgun at Walmart and Gun World in <span class=StateOrCounty>Oklahoma</span> City in November, which he used to shoot his 77-year-old mother to death. He then dismembered her body.</p> <p>Prospective gun owners in <span class=StateOrCounty>Oklahoma</span> must fill out seven pages of paperwork, which is sent to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. Included in that paperwork is a question: Have you ever been adjudicated mentally defective? In other words, have you been ruled a danger to yourself or others or committed to a mental institution?</p> <p>If a person checks yes, the sale is canceled. But if the applicant checks no and is lying, there is no way to verify that, because <span class=StateOrCounty>Oklahoma</span> law prohibits mental health professionals from sending mental health records to the database. Hume checked no on the mental health question before purchasing his guns.</p> <p>House Bill 1240 sought to close the mental illness loophole by requiring county clerks to submit the names of everyone the court found to be mentally defective, and though it captured a majority vote in the House, it died in a Senate committee in the spring.</p> <p>Gun sellers were in favor of getting it done, Miles Hall, president and founder of H&H <span class=Sport>Shooting Sports</span>, told the paper.

But the rate slowed considerably after that, and by the end of the year the city had recorded 415 homicides, 88 fewer than in 2013 and 20 fewer than in 2012.</p> <p>""We are making significant progress by putting <span class=Keyword>additional officers</span> in high-crime areas, using intelligence to prevent retaliatory shootings, moving officers from administrative positions back to the streets,"" <span class=Person>Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy</span> said in a statement.</p> <p>One reason Chicago has been in the national spotlight is that in recent years it has recorded more <span class=Keyword>homicides</span> than larger cities like <span class=City>New York City</span> and <span class=City>Los Angeles</span>. That was again true in 2013, with <span class=Keyword>New York recording</span> 333 homicides, the <span class=Keyword>lowest number</span> since <span class=Keyword>comparable record-keeping</span> began in 1963. And, according to the <span class=City>Los Angeles</span> Times, as of Dec. 28, there were 250 <span class=Keyword>homicides</span> in LA, compared with 298 the year before.</p> <p>In Chicago, the police also said the number of shootings fell <span class=Quantity>24 percent</span> from 2,448 to 1,864 between 2012 and 2013, and the number of shooting victims dropped from 3,066 to 2,328 for the same period. Further, the department said every <span class=Keyword>police district</span> in the city saw a reduction in crime and all but four of the city's 22 police districts saw the number of <span class=Keyword>homicides</span> either fall or remain the same as the year before.</p> <p>The department and other <span class=Keyword>city officials</span> have pointed out that the drop in homicides, shootings and other <span class=Keyword>violent crimes</span> coincides with changes in police strategies, including tactics targeting <span class=Keyword>violent street gangs</span> that are responsible for the vast majority of the city's gun crimes and, significantly, about <span class=Quantity>$100 million</span> in overtime pay for hundreds of officers deployed nightly to high crime areas.</p> <p><span class=Person>Mayor Rahm Emanuel</span> has said that besides putting more officers on the street, various programs for <span class=Keyword>young people</span> have played a role in bringing the numbers of <span class=Keyword>violent crime</span> down. At a recent news conference, for example, the mayor said that a record 20,000 <span class=Keyword>young people</span> were involved in the city's summer jobs program.</p> <p>""Not one of those kids was affected by gun violence this summer, and I don't believe for a minute that if they didn't have jobs they would be safe,"" he said.</p>","Chicago Homicides Down Drastically In 2013 To Fewest Murders Since 1965, Police Say",1/2/14,"Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy, Mayor Rahm Emanuel, Barack Obama, Hadiya Pendleton","New York City, CHICAGO, Los Angeles",Empty,,,on,IL,,,,,,,,,,,,Chicago,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,unknown,unknown,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Extract important information from articles about gun violence.,Read articles and pull out key facts to help us answer questions about gun violence across the country.,"English, research, politics",http://articles.dailypress.com/2013-01-15/news/dp-edt-youthhomicides-editorial-20130115_1_newport-news-mother-teens-achievable-dream,"<p>A <span class=Quantity>27-year</span> old <span class=City>Newport</span> <span class=Keyword>News mother</span> rushed outside her <span class=Keyword>apartment complex</span> where her two sons, ages 2 and 5, were riding their kiddie bikes. She had heard gunshots in the courtyard, and a <span class=Keyword>gut-level instinct</span> propelled her outdoors.</p> <p>As long as there has been motherhood, there have been mothers who reacted quickly when they believed their <span class=Keyword>young ones</span> were in danger. We don't know if this woman reproached the two <span class=Keyword>teens</span> she encountered there or if the look on her face was enough to convey her message.</p> <p>Had such a situation occurred <span class=Quantity>50 years</span> ago, the teens, ages 15 and 16, might have slinked off in contrition for raising the anger of a neighborhood mom. Today, they are charged with <span class=Crime>murder</span> because she was gunned down in that courtyard.</p> <p>Everything is wrong about this Jan. 5 scenario: Shots being fired in a family community. A mother fearing for the lives of her children engaged in innocent play. Her own death by gunshot, leaving two <span class=Keyword>young boys</span> motherless. The accused shooters being hardly more than children themselves.</p> <p>Horrible as it is, stories like these are becoming all too familiar. Last summer, a <span class=Quantity>17-year</span>-old was charged in the <span class=Keyword>bus stop shooting</span> of a <span class=Quantity>57-year</span>-old man during a <span class=Crime>robbery</span> for a wallet and a cell phone. On Nov. 18, a <span class=Quantity>13-year</span>-old was shot while walking with a friend near <span class=Keyword>28th Street</span> and Roanoke Avenue; a <span class=Quantity>15-year</span> old has been charged in the case. In <span class=City>Newport</span> News, people under age 20 were charged in five of the city's 17 homicides last year.</p> <p>For whatever reasons, guns are finding their way into the hands of teens. It's as if firearms have become a central part of their culture, proudly wielded as <span class=Keyword>coming-of-age proof</span> of power and dominance.</p> <p>Yet teens' impulses are notoriously quick, and their abilities to make rational judgments are not fully developed. Combine that with a neighborhood where violence is common, where there is a disconnection from the value of education, where there are low hopes for finding good-paying jobs and where there is a dearth of <span class=Keyword>positive role models</span> and you have the formula for quick-triggered frustration, violence and tragedy.</p> <p>Ours is not the only region affected by these factors. But we have to start somewhere.</p> <p>In 2013, the <span class=PrintMedia>Daily Press</span> will devote a series of <span class=Keyword>news articles</span> and editorials to <span class=Keyword>neighborhood violence</span> and the challenges to breaking down the destructive cycles that contribute to its rampant growth, particularly among teens. We will seek and bring together voices of <span class=FieldTerminology>law enforcement</span>, courts, probation departments, schools, community groups, churches, social service organizations, schools, youth organizations and <span class=Keyword>teens</span> themselves. We invite readers to offer suggestions for topics and/or solutions by using the online form we'll be providing at DailyPress.com/opinion or sending an email to <span class=EmailAddress>rtroyer@dailypress.com</span>.</p> <p>To reverse the disturbing trend, our <span class=Keyword>community conversations</span> must focus not only on causes, but solutions. And then we must act on those solutions. <span class=Keyword>Early intervention programs</span> like Achievable Dream are working; students are completing high school, going on to college or trade school, finding good jobs and becoming successful and contributing members of society. Given the remarkable success rate, how can such principles be expanded to reach more at-risk youth?</p> <p>We also know that <span class=Keyword>community policing</span> of the sort being pursued by the <span class=City>Newport</span> News Police Department in <span class=Keyword>certain targeted neighborhoods</span> can be quite effective in reducing crime and making residents feel safer. These programs should be expanded to other areas of the community and replicated in other localities. There should be increased patrols, public cameras, reporting and prosecution of lesser offenses and most of all, an attitude in the community that says, ""We won't allow this violence on our streets and sidewalks.""</p>",Editorial: Stop the bloodshed - Daily Press,1/15/13,Empty,Newport,Empty,,,,VA,,,,,,,,,,,,Newport News,1/15/13,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,unknown,unknown,unknown,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Extract important information from articles about gun violence.,Read articles and pull out key facts to help us answer questions about gun violence across the country.,"English, research, politics",http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/18/gun-ownership-gun-deaths-study,"<p>Guns do not make a nation safer, say <span class=Country>US</span> doctors who have compared the rate of <span class=Keyword>firearms-related deaths</span> in countries where many people own guns with the <span class=Keyword>death rate</span> in countries where <span class=Keyword>gun ownership</span> is rare.</p> <p>Their findings, published Wednesday in the prestigious <span class=PrintMedia><span class=Continent>America</span>n Journal of Medicine</span>, debunk the historic belief among many people in the United States that guns make a country safer, they say. On the contrary, the <span class=Country>US</span>, with the most guns per head in the world, has the highest rate of deaths from firearms, while <span class=Country>Japan</span>, which has the lowest rate of gun ownership, has the least.</p> <p>The journal has fast-tracked publication of the study because of the shootings at the <span class=Facility><span class=City>Washington</span> navy yard</span>. It was originally scheduled for later this week.</p> <p>It follows an emotional appeal from a doctor at the <span class=FieldTerminology>trauma center</span> in <span class=City>Washington</span> where the victims of <span class=Person>Aaron Alexis</span>' random violence were taken. ""I would like you to put my <span class=FieldTerminology>trauma center</span> out of business,"" <span class=Person>Janis Orlowski</span>, chief <span class=JobTitle>medical officer</span> at <span class=Facility>MedStar <span class=City>Washington</span> Hospital Center</span>, told reporters in the aftermath of the massacre. ""I would like to not be an expert on gunshots. Let's get rid of this. This is not <span class=Continent>America</span>.""</p> <p>The fraught question of whether <span class=Keyword>gun ownership</span> protects populations from crime or makes them less likely to be killed has been debated for 200 years, say the authors, Sripal <span class=City>Bangalore</span> of <span class=Facility>NYU Langone Medical Center</span>, and <span class=Person>Franz H Messerli</span> of <span class=Organization>St Luke</span>'s <span class=Facility>Roosevelt hospital</span>, <span class=Organization>Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons</span>, <span class=City>New York</span>. They say the arguments began as soon as the <span class=FieldTerminology>second amendment</span> stating ""A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed"" was passed in 1791.</p> <p>At one end is the argument that <span class=Keyword>gun control laws</span> are an infringement on the right to self-defense and on <span class=FieldTerminology>constitutional rights</span>, and that there is no evidence that banning <span class=Crime>assault</span> weapons would reduce crime. At the other end is the view that fewer firearms would reduce <span class=Keyword>crime rates</span> and overall lead to greater safety, they say.</p> <p>In some of the <span class=Keyword>recent mass shootings</span>  for instance those in <span class=City>Aurora</span>, Tucson, Oak Creek, <span class=Organization>Virginia Tech</span>  it has been suggested that the killer was mentally ill and that lack of treatment was a bigger issue than gun ownership. With this in mind, the <span class=City>New York</span>-based doctors looked in their study not only at the relationship of <span class=Keyword>gun ownership</span> to <span class=Keyword>firearms deaths</span> but also mental illness.</p> <p>They examined data from 27 developed countries, using <span class=Keyword>gun ownership</span> figures from the <span class=PrintMedia>Small Arms Survey</span> and deaths from the <span class=Organization>World Health Organisation</span>, the <span class=Organization>National Center for Health Statistics</span> and others. They also looked at <span class=Keyword>crime rates</span> compiled by the <span class=Organization>United Nations</span> for an indication of the safety of each country.</p> <p>More guns meant more deaths, they found. ""The <span class=Keyword>gun ownership</span> rate was a strong and independent predictor of firearm-related death,"" says <span class=City>Bangalore</span>. ""Private <span class=Keyword>gun ownership</span> was highest in the <span class=Country>US</span>. <span class=Country>Japan</span>, on the other end, had an extremely low <span class=Keyword>gun ownership</span> rate. Similarly, <span class=Country>South Africa</span> (9.4 per 100,000) and the <span class=Country>US</span> (10.2 per 100,000) had extremely high firearm-related deaths, whereas the <span class=Organization>United Kingdom</span> (0.25 per 100,000) had an <span class=Keyword>extremely low rate</span> of firearm-related deaths.</p> <p>""There was a significant correlation between guns per head per country and the rate of <span class=Keyword>firearm-related deaths</span> with <span class=Country>Japan</span> being on one end of the spectrum and the <span class=Country>US</span> being on the other. This argues against the notion of more guns translating into less crime. <span class=Country>South Africa</span> was the only outlier in that the observed firearms-related <span class=Keyword>death rate</span> was several times higher than expected from gun ownership.""</p> <p>High rates of <span class=Keyword>mental illness</span> in any country, on the other hand, did not predict more gun deaths.</p> <p>""Although correlation is not the same as causation, it seems conceivable that <span class=Keyword>abundant gun availability</span> facilitates firearm-related deaths. Conversely, high <span class=Keyword>crime rates</span> may instigate widespread anxiety and fear, thereby motivating people to arm themselves and give rise to increased gun ownership, which, in turn, increases availability. The resulting vicious cycle could, bit by bit, lead to the polarized status that is now the case with the <span class=Country>US</span>,"" the doctors write.</p> <p>""Regardless of exact cause and effect, the current study debunks the widely quoted hypothesis that countries with higher <span class=Keyword>gun ownership</span> are safer than those with low gun ownership.""</p>","High gun ownership makes countries less safe, US study finds | World news | The Guardian",9/18/13,"Sripal Bangalore, Janis Orlowski, Aaron Alexis, Franz H Messerli","Bangalore, Washington, New York, Aurora",Empty,,,on,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9/18/13,0,,0,Article talking about gun viloence published in the American Journal of Medicine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,unknown,unknown,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Three people were killed Friday, including a <span class=Keyword>carjacking victim</span> whose suspected attacker later barricaded himself in a <span class=City>Charles North</span> nonprofit building and took his own life.</p> <p>The Saturday killing shocked some residents of <span class=GeographicFeature>Mount Vernon</span>, typically one of the <span class=Keyword>safest neighborhoods</span> in the city.

""I mean, this has never happened before, this is the first time. It's scary.""</p> <p>Ajepe said she had been working overnight and had not heard the shots or the crash.</p> <p>She added: ""I hope [the victim] rests in peace.""</p> <p>Police also released the identity of another person killed this week: <span class=Person>Dejuan Willis</span>, 17, fatally stabbed in Southwest <span class=City>Baltimore</span>.

But for the <span class=StateOrCounty>Wisconsin</span> community that lived through the rampage at a <span class=Facility>Sikh temple</span> in <span class=GeographicFeature>Oak Creek</span>, it is a tragedy that will never be forgotten.</p> <p>Just a year ago on Monday, a lone gunman, <span class=Person>Wade Michael Page</span>, 40, a <span class=Organization>U.S. Army</span> veteran with links to racist groups, opened fire on those at the temple, killing six and injuring four others before he killed himself after being wounded by a responding <span class=JobTitle>officer</span>. The shooting was condemned as a <span class=Keyword>hate crime</span> by <span class=JobTitle>official</span>s in the United States and in India.</p> <p>The massacre came less than a month after a lone gunman, <span class=Person>James E. Holmes</span>, attacked a movie theater in <span class=City>Aurora</span>, <span class=StateOrCounty>Colo.</span>, killing 12 and wounding 70. And just months later, in December, yet another <span class=Keyword>lone gunman</span> attacked the <span class=Organization>Sandy Hook Elementary School</span> in <span class=City>Newtown</span>, <span class=StateOrCounty>Conn</span>., where 20 students and six adults were killed. <span class=Person>Adam Lanza</span> began his <span class=Keyword>shooting spree</span> by killing his mother and ended it by shooting himself to death. Holmes is awaiting trial.</p> <p>The trio of massacres led to calls for greater <span class=Keyword>gun control</span> across the nation. Some states, including New York and <span class=StateOrCounty><span class=StateOrCounty>Conn</span>ecticut</span>, toughened gun and ammunition access. But despite calls by the <span class=Organization>Obama administration</span>, federal efforts have been largely stymied.</p> <p>On the anniversary of the <span class=StateOrCounty>Wisconsin</span> shootings, gun-control advocates on Monday renewed their calls for tougher laws.</p> <p>We cannot tolerate hate crimes, and as a nation we must dedicate ourselves to preventing incidents of gun violence,"" said <span class=Person>Dan Gross</span>, <span class=JobTitle>president</span> of the <span class=FieldTerminology>Brady Campaign</span> to Prevent Gun Violence, a <span class=Keyword>gun control</span> group. ""We were heartbroken when we learned of the shooting at the <span class=Facility>Sikh temple</span>. The victims were peaceably gathering in a sacred place and were senselessly gunned down. Our thoughts were with the families of the victims, as they are again today.""</p> <p><span class=Person>Colin Goddard</span>, a survivor of the <span class=Keyword>2007 Virginia Tech shooting</span> and now an <span class=JobTitle>official</span> with the <span class=FieldTerminology>Brady Campaign</span>, was among those attending a vigil and healing ceremony in <span class=GeographicFeature>Oak Creek</span>.</p> <p>On this day, we should pause to remember the loved ones lost. It is not easy to carry on after a shooting. I know this all too well. But there are ways to heal, and the path Ive chosen is through advocacy, Goddard said. The vow I can make to the families in <span class=City>Milwaukee</span> today is, I will never stop fighting for better gun laws, so other families will be spared the pain they are now enduring.</p> <p>The vigils and remembrances began last week.</p> <p>The <span class=Organization>federal government</span> gave a $512,000 grant to fund trauma and <span class=Keyword>mental health services</span> for the Sikh community in southern <span class=StateOrCounty>Wisconsin</span>, according to Atty. <span class=Person>Gen. Eric Holder Jr</span>. The <span class=Organization>federal government</span> also broadened its measurement of hate crimes, adding offenses committed against Sikhs as well as Hindus, Arabs, Buddhists, Mormons, Jehovahs Witnesses and Orthodox Christians.</p> <p>Im confident that this change will help us better understand the <span class=Keyword>law enforcement challenges</span> we face. It will empower us to better enforce relevant laws to protect everyone in this country. And it is emblematic of our unwavering resolve to prevent and seek justice for acts of hate and terror, Holder stated.</p> <p>Those killed on Aug. 5, 2012, were <span class=Person>Satwant Singh Kaleka</span>, 65, the <span class=JobTitle>president</span> of the congregation; <span class=Person>Sita Singh</span>, 41; <span class=Person>Ranjit Singh</span>, 49; <span class=Person>Prakash Singh</span>, 39; Paramjit Kaur, 41; and Suveg Singh, 84.</p> <p>On Monday, families of the victims will be joined by <span class=Keyword>gun control</span> advocates, including Mayors Against Illegal Guns, as well as the mayors of <span class=GeographicFeature>Oak Creek</span> and <span class=City>Milwaukee</span>.</p> <p>On Sunday, hundreds of people, including <span class=StateOrCounty>Wisconsin</span> Gov.

Extract important information from articles about gun violence.,Read articles and pull out key facts to help us answer questions about gun violence across the country.,"English, research, politics",http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mary-anne-franks/stand-your-grounds-woman-_b_4886650.html,"<p>In 2012 editorial,  father-and-son <span class=StateOrCounty>Florida</span> politicians <span class=Person>Don</span> and <span class=Person>Matt Gaetz</span> called criticism of the state's controversial <span class=Keyword>Stand Your Ground</span>  law ""anti-woman.""  ""Consider,"" they gravely intoned, ""an elderly <span class=Keyword>woman</span> in a dimly lit parking lot or a college girl walking to her dorm at night. If she was attacked, her duty was to turn her back and try to flee, probably be overcome and <span class=Crime>rape</span>d or killed. ... Calls to repeal 'Stand Your Ground' are anti-woman. Imposing a duty-to-flee places the safety of the <span class=Keyword>rapist</span> above a woman's own life.""</p> <p>These claims echo those made in 2005 by <span class=Person>Marion Hammer</span>, whose lobbying efforts as the former <span class=JobTitle>president</span> of the <span class=Organization>National Rifle Association</span> led to <span class=StateOrCounty>Florida</span> becoming the first state to pass a <span class=Keyword>Stand Your Ground</span> law. Like the Gaetzes, Hammer illustrated the need for <span class=Keyword>Stand Your Ground</span> by invoking a stranger <span class=Crime>rape</span> scenario: ""The duty to retreat had been imposed by the system and essentially if someone had tried to drag a <span class=Keyword>woman</span> into an alley to <span class=Crime>rape</span> her, the <span class=Keyword>women</span> [sic] -- even though she might be licensed to carry concealed and ready to protect herself, the law would not allow her to do it. It required her to try to get away and run and be chased down by the perpetrator before she could then use force to protect herself.""  Hammer's conclusion, like the Gaetzes, is clear: if you do not support Stand Your Ground, you support <span class=Crime>rape</span>.</p> <p>A similar sentiment ran through NRA <span class=JobTitle>Executive Vice President</span> <span class=Person>Wayne LaPierre</span>'s speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference in 2013, in which he singled out ""young women"" for the following message: ""the one thing a violent <span class=Keyword>rapist</span> deserves to face is a good <span class=Keyword>woman</span> with a gun.""  <span class=PrintMedia>Fox</span> News host <span class=Person>Sean Hannity</span> jumped on the <span class=Crime>rape</span> bandwagon as well, expressing outrage at the ""Left"" for failing to acknowledge the supposed need for <span class=Keyword>women</span> to carry concealed weapons to protect themselves against <span class=Crime>rape</span> (this included criticizing an actual <span class=Crime>rape</span> victim, <span class=Person>Zerlina Maxwell</span>, for rejecting the supposed wisdom of armed responses to <span class=Crime>rape</span> -- the response from many of the show's fans included, with no apparent sense of irony, <span class=Crime>rape</span> threats).</p> <p>The solicitude for <span class=Crime>rape</span> victims in the context of armed <span class=Keyword>self-defense</span> stands in sharp contrast to the way <span class=Crime>rape</span> generally tends to figure in right-wing discourse. Republican politicians and candidates made headlines during the 2012 election season for making unsympathetic, offensive, and outright inaccurate statements about <span class=Crime>rape</span>. From <span class=Person>Todd Akin</span>'s infamous assertion that <span class=Keyword>women</span> rarely get pregnant as a result of ""legitimate"" <span class=Crime>rape</span> because ""the female body has ways to try to shut the whole thing down"" to <span class=Person>Paul Ryan</span> calling <span class=Crime>rape</span> ""a method of conception,"" Republicans were widely criticized for trivializing and defending sexual <span class=Crime>assault</span>.  This flurry of ill-advised public statements prompted commentators to note that Republican antipathy to <span class=Crime>rape</span> victims has been characteristic of the party long before 2012.  An example that has recently come to light is <span class=StateOrCounty>Maine</span> <span class=Person>Rep. Lawrence Lockman</span>'s 1990 suggestion that if abortion is legal, it's only fair to allow men to <span class=Crime>rape</span> women: ""If a <span class=Keyword>woman</span> has [the right to an abortion], why shouldn't a man be free to use his superior strength to force himself on a woman? At least the rapist's pursuit of sexual freedom doesn't [in most cases] result in anyone's death.""</p> <p>What then explains the exalted status of the vulnerable <span class=Crime>rape</span> victim for the armed <span class=Keyword>self-defense</span> crowd? The rhetoric of <span class=Keyword>Stand Your Ground</span> can certainly be very seductive: it is tempting to imagine a world in which a <span class=Keyword>woman</span> faces down a street harasser, fights off a rapist, or stops an abusive <span class=JobTitle>partner</span> in his tracks. It is even more seductive to imagine a world in which a <span class=Keyword>woman</span> is encouraged, praised and supported for fighting back in these ways. No doubt this is partly why <span class=Keyword>Stand Your Ground</span> supporters so often invoke the image of <span class=Keyword>woman</span> in an alley fighting off a violent <span class=Keyword>rapist</span> to justify expanding the uses of deadly force.</p> <p>But the choice of a stranger <span class=Crime>rape</span> scenario is a telling one. Of all the interpersonal threats <span class=Keyword>women</span> and girls are likely to face in their lifetimes, including street <span class=Crime>harassment</span>, acquaintance <span class=Crime>rape</span>, and <span class=FieldTerminology>domestic violence</span>, stranger <span class=Crime>rape</span> is one of the rarest. The vast majority of <span class=Crime>rape</span> victims -- more than two-thirds -- are <span class=Crime>assault</span>ed by someone they know. The vast majority of <span class=Crime>rape</span>s also do not take place in the street; they happen in houses, apartments, cars, and dorm rooms. So while the image of a pistol-packing <span class=Keyword>woman</span> triumphantly dispatching a lurking <span class=Keyword>rapist</span> is compelling, such a scenario is statistically unlikely (as well as unrealistic, but that is a topic for another time).</p> <p>This is no doubt the real reason that <span class=Keyword>Stand Your Ground</span> proponents, conservative pundits, and gun activists love the stranger <span class=Crime>rape</span> example. Its value is purely rhetorical. It allows the speaker to claim concern for women's safety, and even more importantly, to decry critics as ""anti-woman,"" without so much as causing a ripple on the surface of entrenched, commonplace violence against women.  It is utterly safe to condemn the stranger <span class=Keyword>rapist</span> -- he is an outlier, a monster. The stranger <span class=Keyword>rapist</span> can be vilified without casting guilty shadows on mainstream society. Women who fight back against stranger rapists do not destabilize sexual order or challenge gender-disciplining norms.</p> <p>By contrast, consider how <span class=Keyword>Stand Your Ground</span> proponents regard the vastly more common kind of violence that <span class=Keyword>women</span> are likely to face: violence from intimate <span class=JobTitle>partner</span>s. Of all the categories of victims who might justifiably agitate for more protection from the law, <span class=Keyword>women</span> facing down abusive <span class=JobTitle>partner</span>s in their own homes should be at the top of the list. And yet <span class=Keyword>Stand Your Ground</span> laws do nothing to help protect victims of <span class=FieldTerminology>domestic violence</span> who use <span class=Keyword>deadly force</span> against abusive <span class=JobTitle>partner</span>s. This is not by accident but by design.</p> <p>To put this in context, it is important to clarify just what <span class=StateOrCounty>Florida</span>'s Stand Your <span class=Keyword>Ground law</span> actually does. In the wake of the <span class=Person>Michael Dunn</span> and <span class=Person>George Zimmerman</span> trials, there has been much confusion and heated disagreement about the role of <span class=Keyword>Stand Your Ground</span> in violent confrontations. On the one hand, it is correct that the law's most infamous provision allowing individuals to ""stand their <span class=Keyword>ground</span> and meet force with force"" is not for the most part a departure from traditional <span class=Keyword>self-defense</span> doctrine. The law does not on its face radically alter the duty to retreat; the duty to retreat has historically been understood to apply only in situations where one can retreat ""with complete safety and without undue sacrifice of one's liberty.""  That is, if <span class=Person>George Zimmerman</span>'s and <span class=Person>Michael Dunn</span>'s accounts of being threatened with serous <span class=Keyword>bodily injury</span> prior to the moment they shot their victims were true, they would not, under traditional <span class=FieldTerminology>self-defense law</span>, have had a duty to retreat.</p> <p>Much of the confusion about <span class=Keyword>Stand Your Ground</span> eliminating a supposed duty to retreat comes from the law's own proponents. Note how <span class=Person>Don</span> and <span class=Person>Matt Gaetz</span> claim in their editorial that before Stand Your Ground, a <span class=Keyword>woman</span> threatened by a <span class=Keyword>rapist</span> had a duty ""to turn her back and try to flee, probably be overcome and <span class=Crime>rape</span>d or killed. Prior to 'Stand Your Ground,' that victim didn't have the choice to defend herself, to meet force with force."" <span class=Person>Marion Hammer</span> similarly asserts that pre-Stand Your <span class=Keyword>Ground law</span> imposed a duty to retreat on potential <span class=Crime>rape</span> victims: ""It required her to try to get away and run and be chased down by the perpetrator before she could then use force to protect herself."" But the claim that a <span class=Keyword>woman</span> would not have been allowed to defend herself from a threatened <span class=Crime>rape</span> prior to <span class=Keyword>Stand Your Ground</span> is not an accurate statement of the law. A <span class=Keyword>woman</span> dragged into an alley by a would-be <span class=Keyword>rapist</span> would likely not be able to retreat at all, much less in complete safety, and thus would be authorized to use <span class=Keyword>deadly force</span> without any recourse to Stand Your Ground.</p> <p>On the other hand, the insistence that <span class=Keyword>Stand Your Ground</span> plays no role in deadly confrontations is disingenuous at best. Regardless of whether <span class=Keyword>Stand Your Ground</span> is specifically invoked in any particular case, the concern that it encourages a ""shoot first"" mentality, especially one overlaid with racial biases, is well-founded. The law moreover does in fact include several innovations that run contrary to traditional limitations on self-defense. One is that it authorizes individuals to use <span class=Keyword>deadly force</span> not only to prevent death or serious bodily injury, but also the commission of any ""forcible felony,"" which includes <span class=Crime>robbery</span>. This is a significant departure from the long-held belief that the use of <span class=Keyword>deadly force</span> should not be used to protect mere property. Inasmuch as this belief reflects the principle that life is precious and should not be taken except under extraordinary circumstances, this is an innovation that fosters disrespect for human life. The law also allows for presumptions about the need for <span class=Keyword>deadly force</span> against persons who unlawfully enter homes or vehicles regardless of whether such persons pose an immediate threat.</p> <p>But perhaps the most unsettling innovation of <span class=StateOrCounty>Florida</span>'s <span class=Keyword>Stand Your Ground</span> law, the one that arguably does the most to shift social defaults away from respecting human life, is the provision that provides immunity from criminal prosecution to those who claim self-defense. That means that a person who intentionally kills another person may not only avoid having to demonstrate to a jury that he acted in self-defense; he may avoid being arrested at all.  Even if arrested, a killer can request a special immunity hearing at which his claim of <span class=Keyword>self-defense</span> need only meet a ""preponderance of the evidence."" The implications of this are staggering: the weighty, complex determination whether a person acted reasonably and justifiably in using <span class=Keyword>deadly force</span> may be disposed of by a police <span class=JobTitle>officer</span>'s impressions. Whether or not such immunity is granted in any particular case does not resolve the question of the provision's influence on social understandings of justifiable force and killing with impunity.</p> <p>So let us return to the question of whether <span class=Keyword>Stand Your Ground</span> protects <span class=Keyword>women</span> in the violent encounters they are mostly likely to face. When asked if it was correct that <span class=Keyword>Stand Your Ground</span> did not apply in <span class=FieldTerminology>domestic violence</span> situations, <span class=Person>Marion Hammer</span> answered, ""Yes."" Her explanation was as follows: ""the law attempts to say that if in a <span class=FieldTerminology>domestic violence</span> situation you are being beaten you may use self-defense, but you can't simply take action against an estranged spouse who breaks into the home if they own the home. You have to be under attack in those situations."" This note of restraint is incongruous with the rest of the <span class=Keyword>Stand Your Ground</span> provisions. A person can presume that a stranger breaking into his house means him harm, and can thus use <span class=Keyword>deadly force</span> against the stranger. A <span class=FieldTerminology>domestic violence</span> victim cannot presume that the person who has been beating her or has threatened to kill her -- even a person against whom she has obtained a protective order -- means her harm if he enters their home, and she cannot use <span class=Keyword>deadly force</span> against him until the moment he attacks her. Hammer elaborates that this provision was a result of the drafters' effort to ensure ""that in restoring your <span class=Keyword>self-defense</span> rights and your right to protect your home.... they did not set up scenarios where people could <span class=Crime>murder</span> people they did not like and claim it was lawful self-defense.""</p> <p>The architects of <span class=Keyword>Stand Your Ground</span> are, in other words, openly hostile to the use of <span class=Keyword>deadly force</span> by victims of <span class=FieldTerminology>domestic violence</span>. Women threatened in their homes are actually placed at a distinct disadvantage not only compared to men threatened in their homes, but to men in any place where they have a right to be. <span class=Keyword>Stand Your Ground</span> does in fact openly assume, if not embrace, the risk of allowing individuals to ""<span class=Crime>murder</span> people they did not like and claim it was lawful self-defense,"" even outside of the home, so long as the killers are men (preferably white) and their victims are strangers (preferably black). What it refuses to do is to allow a <span class=FieldTerminology>domestic violence</span> victim to fight back, even when confronted by a known abuser in her own home.</p> <p>To see this, we need look no farther than the very different treatment of <span class=Person>George Zimmerman</span> and <span class=Person>Marissa Alexander</span>, two <span class=StateOrCounty>Florida</span> cases that raised <span class=Keyword>Stand Your Ground</span> issues. <span class=Person>George Zimmerman</span>, a white-Hispanic male, avoided arrest for six weeks after shooting an unarmed black teenager to death and was eventually acquitted of all charges. <span class=Person>Marissa Alexander</span>, a black woman, was immediately arrested after firing a warning shot at her abusive husband and sentenced to 20 years for aggravated <span class=Crime>assault</span> with a firearm.</p> <p>The failure to arrest Zimmerman stemmed from the police's determination that he had acted in self-defense; the police's immediate arrest of Alexander expressed the opposite determination. Alexander requested a <span class=Keyword>Stand Your Ground</span> hearing, where the judge ruled that she did not act in self-defense. This was despite the fact that <span class=Person>Marissa Alexander</span> appears to be the ideal <span class=Keyword>Stand Your Ground</span> candidate: she had a protective order against a person who did in fact threaten her with great bodily injury, according to the latter's own sworn deposition. In addition to all of this, Alexander, unlike Zimmerman, did try to retreat -- repeatedly. It was only at the moment that she realized she physically could not retreat, and that her husband was threatening her life, that she fired a warning shot. A warning shot, even though a person in her circumstances presumably would have had the right, under <span class=StateOrCounty>Florida</span> law, to shoot to kill.</p> <p>After being denied immunity, Alexander was tried and convicted of three counts of aggravated <span class=Crime>assault</span> with a firearm, resulting in a 20-year sentence. On appeal, the court found that the trial court had improperly shifted the burden on Alexander to prove she was acting in self-defense, as opposed to the prosecution having to prove that she was not, and granted her a new trial. The court also held, however, that the lower court acted properly in denying Alexander immunity from prosecution based on Stand Your Ground. Prosecutor <span class=Person>Angela Corey</span> -- the same prosecutor in charge of the Zimmerman prosecution -- is seeking to increase Alexander's punishment on retrial, from 20 to 60 years.</p> <p>Alexander, having been denied the protection of Stand Your Ground, will likely be forced to argue Battered Women's <span class=HealthCondition>Syndrome</span> in her defense. That is significant for several reasons. First, the consequences of using Battered Women's <span class=HealthCondition>Syndrome</span> vs. <span class=Keyword>Stand Your Ground</span> are very different with regard to investigation and evidence. As discussed above, if <span class=FieldTerminology>law enforcement</span> determines that a person has acted according to Stand Your Ground, the person is not even arrested, to say nothing of prosecuted. That means there is no examination whatsoever of the person who used <span class=Keyword>deadly force</span> beyond an initial police interrogation -- no presentation of evidence, no hiring of lawyers and experts, and no loss of liberty. There are no comparable immunity procedures for Battered Women's <span class=HealthCondition>Syndrome</span> defense, and the defense requires extensive evidentiary findings, expert testimony, and intense evaluation of the defendant's life.</p> <p>Furthermore, Battered Women's <span class=HealthCondition>Syndrome</span> is often thought of as an ""excuse defense,"" as opposed to a ""justification defense"" like Stand Your Ground. Both excuse defenses and justification defenses can result in acquittals or reduced sentences, but they communicate very different judgments about the acts of the defendants. Finding that an act was justified is commonly understood to signify moral approval of the act. By contrast, a finding of excuse expresses moral condemnation for the defendant's act; the defendant is ""excused"" on the basis of some serious moral or psychological defect.</p> <p>Stand Your Ground defendants avoid punishment while engendering admiration for their supposed courage; Battered Women's <span class=HealthCondition>Syndrome</span> defendants are forced to plead for mercy for their supposed weakness. The narrative that Alexander will be forced to relate is one of a helpless <span class=Keyword>woman</span> who felt she had no choice other than to use <span class=Keyword>deadly force</span> against her abuser, whereas Zimmerman (and Dunn, and many others) can invoke the narrative of a man standing up for himself against a violent interloper.</p> <p>Stand Your <span class=Keyword>Ground laws</span> not only fail to protect women; they actually reinforce and exacerbate existing gender divides in <span class=FieldTerminology>self-defense law</span>. The cynical appropriation of women's right to <span class=Keyword>self-defense</span> by <span class=Keyword>Stand Your Ground</span> supporters masks the law's actual hostility towards women's use of force, including its continued stigmatization of <span class=Keyword>women</span> who fight back. At the same time, the female empowerment rhetoric of <span class=Keyword>Stand Your Ground</span> obscures the real achievement of such legislation: the normalization and promotion of (often white) male violence in an ever-expanding number of scenarios.</p>",Stand Your Ground's Woman Problem: Laws Expanding Self-Defense Raise Questions About Gender as Well as Race|Mary Anne Franks,3/3/14,"George Zimmerman, Marissa Alexander, Marion Hammer, Michael Dunn, Don, Matt Gaetz, Todd Akin, Wayne LaPierre, Sean Hannity, Rep.

""Retail inventories, which had been in short supply last spring, have largely returned to normal now,"" wrote <span class=Person>Rommel Dionisio</span>, a gun industry <span class=JobTitle>analyst</span> for <span class=Company>Wedbush</span>, in a recent report.</p> <p>""Monthly comparisons have recently turned sharply negative, a trend we expect to last through at least May or June 2014,"" Dionisio wrote.</p> <p>Dionisio said the ""feared tightening of gun control legislation,"" which was the initial motivation for buying up <span class=Keyword>guns</span> and ammo at such a frenetic pace, has subsided.</p> <p>Gun purchases increased sharply after the reelection of President <span class=Person>Obama</span>, rising by about <span class=Quantity>25%</span> in November of 2012, compared to the month before, according to <span class=Organization>FBI</span> background checks. They increased even more dramatically, by nearly <span class=Quantity>40%</span>, the following month, when a gunman used a <span class=Keyword>Bushmaster semiautomatic rifle</span> with <span class=Keyword>high-capacity magazines</span> and other <span class=Keyword>guns</span> to kill 20 children and six educators at an elementary school in <span class=City>Newtown</span>, <span class=StateOrCounty>Conn</span>.</p> <p>Those events fueled fears among <span class=Keyword>gun advocates</span> that the <span class=JobTitle>president</span> would impose <span class=Keyword>stricter restrictions</span> on guns.</p> <p>But <span class=Person>Obama</span>'s proposed bill, which would have reenacted the <span class=Crime>assault</span> rifle ban that expired in 2004, did not pass <span class=Organization>Congress</span>. Some states, like <span class=StateOrCounty><span class=StateOrCounty>Conn</span>ecticut</span> and <span class=StateOrCounty>California</span>, have successfully passed further gun restrictions, but these efforts have failed on a federal level.</p> <p>Related: Pink is the new black for women who shoot guns</p> <p>Though <span class=Keyword>gun sales</span> have dropped from their peak last year, they're still outperforming monthly sales that preceded <span class=Person>Obama</span>'s reelection, said <span class=Person>Lawrence Keane</span>, spokesman for the <span class=Organization>National Shooting Sports Foundation</span>, the gun <span class=FieldTerminology>industry group</span> based in <span class=City>Newtown</span>.</p> <p>For example, the tally of 1.66 million <span class=Keyword>gun sales</span> in January, 2014 is significantly higher than the 1.38 million sold in January, 2012.</p> <p>""So we have come down from the peak but the valley floor is higher than before Nov 2012,"" said Keane, in an email to CNNMoney.

The initial call from dispatch was that three people had been shot at the location. The <span class=Person>Deputy</span> arrived and found a white female, <span class=Quantity>33 year</span> old <span class=Person>Kathy Mchan Flynn</span>, walking down the driveway of <span class=FieldTerminology>the house</span> toward the deputy. She indicated that both she, and her daughter, had been shot by her husband, 50 year old Benny Mark Flynn. She told the <span class=Person>Deputy</span> that her husband was in <span class=FieldTerminology>the house</span> and had shot himself. A neighbor was holding the injured child when the <span class=Person>Deputy</span> arrived and shortly thereafter a First Responder came from a few blocks away and began administering aid. As of the time of this release both the victims were doing well and expected to recover.</p> <p>A call for back up by the responding <span class=Person>Deputy</span> brought and off-duty <span class=Person>Deputy</span> to the scene within minutes at which time the Deputies entered the home in an attempt to determine the whereabouts of Mr. Flynn. They found <span class=Keyword>Mr. Flynn</span> in the master bedroom of the home apparently dead of a <span class=Keyword>single self-inflicted gunshot</span> wound to the head. Later that evening <span class=Keyword>Benny Mark Flynn</span> was in fact pronounced dead by the <span class=StateOrCounty>Lanier County</span> coroner. The firearm believed to be used was recovered at the scene.</p> <p>The victims were medically attended to and transported from the area by <span class=Company>Emergency Medical</span> personnel and other First Responder units. The mother was taken to <span class=Facility>South Georgia Medical Center</span> and the child was transported by Life Flight to <span class=City>Gainseville</span> after having been transported to a <span class=Keyword>suitable pick-up site</span> by <span class=StateOrCounty>Berrien County</span> Sheriffs Office who had arrived on the scene and were rendering mutual aid.</p> <p>The scene was taped-off and secured pending the arrival of investigators.</p> <p>A <span class=StateOrCounty>Lanier County</span> <span class=JobTitle>Investigator</span> was summoned and he in turn contacted the <span class=Keyword>Georgia Bureau</span> of Investigation for assistance with the investigation. Within less than <span class=Quantity>30 minutes</span> the <span class=Organization>GBI</span> <span class=JobTitle>Investigator</span> as well as two <span class=Organization>GBI</span> <span class=Organization>Crime Scene Technicians</span> and their <span class=Keyword>mobile forensic lab</span> arrived on the scene and met with the <span class=StateOrCounty>Lanier County</span> <span class=JobTitle>Investigator</span> and Sheriff <span class=Person>Nick Norton</span>. A canvas of the immediate neighborhood was conducted along with detailed interviews of all available witnesses and emergency personnel. Simultaneously, <span class=Organization>GBI</span> and Sheriffs Office <span class=Keyword>investigators</span> obtained a <span class=FieldTerminology>search warrant</span> for a deeper search of the crime scene and the <span class=Organization>Crime Scene Technicians</span> began the lengthy task of gathering all physical evidence and determining what that evidence might indicate. Technicians processed the scene for more than 9 hours to insure that nothing was overlooked. The <span class=Keyword>investigators</span> went directly to the hospital in an effort to check on Kathy Flynns condition and attempt an interview but were not able to do so at that time. While there they briefed Mrs. Flynns mother and sister concerning the incident and then returned to the scene to continue the investigation and witness interviews.</p> <p>Exact details of the incident are not ready for release as the investigation is far from complete, but at this point is believed that the argument which escalated into the shooting developed very quickly and as <span class=Keyword>Mrs. Flynn</span> attempted to leave to prevent further argument, <span class=Keyword>Mr. Flynn</span> apparently fired several rounds at Mrs. Flynn. <span class=JobTitle>Investigator</span>s have nothing to indicate that <span class=Keyword>Mr. Flynn</span> targeted his daughter. They think, and hope, that she was simply an unintended victim of a fit of rage that escalated out of control on behalf of Mr. Flynn. There has been some indication that drugs and/or alcohol may have played a part in the incident and <span class=Keyword>investigators</span> will wait for lab results and further interviews to determine that.</p> <p>The <span class=Organization>GBI</span> has assumed lead investigative responsibility for the case and will be working closely with the <span class=StateOrCounty>Lanier County</span> Sheriffs Office. <span class=Person>Sheriff Norton</span> indicated that the support received by the <span class=Organization>GBI</span>, and other area <span class=FieldTerminology>emergency services</span> and <span class=FieldTerminology>law enforcement</span> personnel was unbelievably swift and determined. He expressed his gratitude to all those on the scene and those that conducted transport, as well as the many citizens and hospital <span class=Organization>ER</span> staff who assisted.</p> <p><span class=Person>Sheriff Norton</span> has asked for prayers for a speedy recovery for the victim as well as for the loss of the <span class=Keyword>Flynn family</span> in this senseless tragedy.</p> <p>February 17, 2013</p> <p><span class=Company>Lanier Co.</span>, <span class=StateOrCounty>GA</span> - A mother and her child are recovering in the hospital after being shot by the child's father Saturday.  <span class=JobTitle>Investigator</span>s say the man then turned the gun on himself.</p> <p><span class=StateOrCounty>Lanier County</span> Sheriff <span class=Person>Nick Norton</span> calls it a ""tragedy"".  An <span class=FieldTerminology>attempted murder</span> suicide.  But the only one left dead was the father.</p> <p>The shooting happened in a house just off Highway 125 in Western <span class=StateOrCounty>Lanier County</span> just south of <span class=City>Ray City</span>.  Authorities responded to the call a little before 1 pm Saturday afternoon.</p> <p>They found all three occupants had been shot, but only one of them dead: the father.  Several agencies responded to the scene including the <span class=Keyword>Georgia Bureau</span> of Investigation.</p> <p>Neighbors we talked to where simply stunned.</p> <p>""The yard was just full of officers and they were taping off <span class=FieldTerminology>the house</span>.  Immediately it was panic because that was absolutely just not expected, particularly for the neighborhood we live in,"" said <span class=Person>Jessica Parker</span>, a neighbor who lives almost right across the street.</p> <p>The mother and daughter are reportedly in treatment.  Both are in serious but stable condition.  The father was declared dead at the scene.</p> <p><span class=JobTitle>Investigator</span>s have not released any of their names while they are notifying family members.

She was not hurt, he said, but a woman sitting on her porch 15-20 feet away was hit by one of the bullets.</p> <p>News Affairs <span class=Person><span class=JobTitle>Officer</span> Alfaro</span>, however, said the 57-year-old woman who was shot was the woman inside the man's car and there was only one gunman.</p> <p>Paramedics got there and bandaged the man up and he wasn't taken to a hospital, he said. The woman, whose wounds were to the lower right leg <span class=Keyword>Alfaro</span> said, was taken to <span class=Facility>Roseland Community Hospital</span>, where her condition had stabilized.</p> <p>The motive for the shooting was not known, said Alfaro, and no arrests have been made.</p> <p>A few minutes earlier, at 2:10 a.m., <span class=Person>Edward Jordan</span>, 53, was shot in the face in the 300 block of <span class=Keyword>South Cicero Avenue</span> in the <span class=Keyword>South Austin neighborhood</span> on the West Side, according to police and the <span class=Facility>Cook Couny</span> <span class=FieldTerminology>medical examiner</span>'s office.

PAUL - The number of <span class=StateOrCounty><span class=StateOrCounty>Minnesota</span></span>ns who struggle to put enough food on the table remains at its highest level since the government started counting two decades ago. A new report from the <span class=Organization>U.S. Department of Agriculture</span> says about one in 10 <span class=StateOrCounty><span class=StateOrCounty>Minnesota</span></span> households doesn't have access to enough food for healthy living.</p> <p>The report is the closest thing the government has to an official hunger count. Once a year, census workers ask people all over the country a series of questions about food. Questions like: ""In the last 12 months, were you ever hungry, but didn't eat because there wasn't enough money for food?"" The government then calculates how many people are ""food insecure,"" a wonky way of saying they lack consistent access to enough food.</p> <p>This latest report shows 10.6 percent of <span class=StateOrCounty><span class=StateOrCounty>Minnesota</span></span> households are food insecure. It also shows that 4.8 percent fall in more severe category called ""very low <span class=FieldTerminology>food security</span>,"" which means they sometimes ate less than they should have or skipped meals due to insufficient funds.</p> <p><span class=StateOrCounty><span class=StateOrCounty>Minnesota</span></span> is doing better than the national average of 14.5 percent, but the state's numbers seem stuck at an all-time high, and they've been there for several years. <span class=Person>Colleen Moriarty</span>, who directs Hunger Solutions <span class=StateOrCounty><span class=StateOrCounty>Minnesota</span></span>, says we shouldn't expect the problem to go away anytime soon because people hit by the recession are still trying to recover.</p> <p>But Moriarty points to a sign that things are improving: Food shelves, which saw double-digit increases in visits during the recession, have watched those numbers start to level off.

When you are finished working you rarely hang around and go directly to your car and LEAVE !!

What set him off?</p> <p>Investigators gave the following timeline:</p> <p>At 7:36 a.m., <span class=Keyword>Thornton</span> arrived at 2716 Independence Way in <span class=City>Grove City</span>. Police said he had once lived there with Fitzpatrick, with whom he has a 17-year-old son. <span class=Person><span class=City>Jaiden</span></span> was not his child.</p> <p>The 9-year-old answered the door and was immediately shot, <span class=Organization><span class=City>Grove City</span> Police</span> <span class=Person>Capt.

Two of her sons, including Thorntons son, called 911.</p> <p>Stay with me <span class=Person><span class=City>Jaiden</span></span>, the <span class=Keyword>older brother</span> pleaded in the call. Come on buddy. Come on buddy. Come on <span class=Person><span class=City>Jaiden</span></span>. Open your eyes <span class=Person><span class=City>Jaiden</span></span>.</p> <p>He identified his father as the shooter, saying, He knocked on the (expletive) door, shot him, and took off.</p> <p>He also told <span class=Keyword>police</span> that <span class=Keyword>Thornton</span> wants suicide by cop.</p> <p><span class=Organization>South-Western City Schools</span> spokeswoman Sandy Nekoloff said <span class=Person><span class=City>Jaiden</span></span> attended Monterey Elementary School.</p> <p><span class=Person><span class=City>Jaiden</span></span> often played with neighbor <span class=Person>Nick Saint</span>s son.</p> <p>He was always a yes sir, no sir kind of kid, Saint said. You can tell hes had some structure in the home.</p> <p>Hes an angel pretty much, Thorntons son, Jarid Fitzpatrick, told WBNS-TV (Channel 10). He didnt deserve this. He wanted everybody to love him.</p> <p>Thornton next turned up at 8:01 a.m. at the dental office of Mark Pitts at 4409 Crossroads Center and shot Vertin, who <span class=Keyword>police</span> said also is a former girlfriend of Thorntons. Birth records show that Vertin has an 18-year-old daughter with Thornton.</p> <p>In a call to 911, a co-worker said <span class=Keyword>Thornton</span> walked into the office and shot Vertin, a dental hygienist, when she met him in the lobby.</p> <p>Police linked the shooting to the <span class=City>Grove City</span> shooting within six minutes, records show, because 911 calls made from both locations named him as the shooter.</p> <p>Officers learned that <span class=Keyword>Thornton</span> had been living at a <span class=City>North Side</span> motel, so they began checking the area of Morse Road and Rt. 161. They also heard from the two friends he had called.</p> <p>He said that hes killed two people and that hes not going back to jail, Weiner quoted the friends as saying.</p> <p>Police would not say how, but they and the <span class=Organization>FBI</span> found <span class=Keyword>Thornton</span> sitting in his car in the parking lot of the <span class=Company>Walmart</span> just north of <span class=Facility>Easton Town Center</span>. At 9:46 a.m., they surrounded Thorntons car with two <span class=Keyword>police</span> cars.</p> <p>There was an exchange of gunfire and both <span class=Keyword>Thornton</span> and Smith were struck, Weiner said.</p> <p>Two other <span class=City>SWAT</span> <span class=JobTitle>officer</span>s, Lawrence Brown and Glenn Thivener, fired guns but were not hurt.</p> <p>When he was younger, <span class=Keyword>Thornton</span> boxed in <span class=City>Columbus</span> Recreation and Parks matches as a representative of the <span class=Keyword>Sawyer Recreation Center</span> on the <span class=GeographicFeature>South Side</span>. He fought professionally for a time.</p> <p>He also racked up a history of arrests on charges ranging from <span class=Crime>assault</span> to domestic violence.

Extract important information from articles about gun violence.,Read articles and pull out key facts to help us answer questions about gun violence across the country.,"English, research, politics",http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/02/us/elliot-rodger-killings-in-california-followed-years-of-withdrawal.html?hp&_r=0,"<p><span class=City>LOS ANGELES</span>  It was the summer of 1999, and the <span class=Keyword>parents</span> of <span class=Person>Elliot O. Rodger</span> were battling over the boys deep and <span class=Keyword>puzzling psychological problems</span> as they struggled through a divorce.</p> <p>Mr. Rodgers mother, <span class=Person>Li Chin</span>, filed an affidavit describing Elliot as a high-functioning autistic child, and said she needed more <span class=FieldTerminology>child support</span> to care for him. His father, Peter Rodger, countered with a <span class=City>Beverly Hills</span> doctor, <span class=Person>Stephen M. Scappa</span>, who challenged that diagnosis, saying it failed to acknowledge the possibility of depression or anxiety. Dr. Scappa said that Elliot, almost 8 at the time, should be sent to a child psychiatrist for more examination and treatment.</p> <p>Last week, days after <span class=Keyword>Mr. Rodger</span> killed six people on May 23 in a rampage in <span class=City>Isla Vista</span>, <span class=StateOrCounty>Calif.</span>, before firing a bullet into his head, his estranged <span class=Keyword>parents</span> released an anguished statement, expressing their distress as they grappled with the final chapter of their 22-year-old sons long struggle with emotional problems. It is now our responsibility to do everything we can to help avoid this happening to any other family  not only to avoid any more innocence destroyed, but also to identify and deal with the mental issues that drove our son to do what he did, the statement said. The <span class=Keyword>parents</span> declined to be interviewed.</p> <p>For as long as anyone close to them can remember, the <span class=Keyword>parents</span> had faced concerns about the boys mental health  a shadow that hung over this <span class=Keyword>Los Angeles family</span> nearly every day of Elliots life. Confronted with a lonely and introverted child, they tried to set him up on play dates, ferried him from counselor to therapist, urged him to take antipsychotic medication and moved him from school to school. His mother gave her son the car he thought would help improve his stature  a black <span class=Company>BMW</span>  when he went off to college in <span class=City>Santa Barbara</span>; he used it for his lonely explorations of the <span class=StateOrCounty>California</span> coast, as a setting for his <span class=Keyword>chilling farewell video</span> and finally as a weapon as he sprayed bullets from the window and plowed down bicyclists that Friday night.</p> <p>It is almost impossible to tell if a person struggling with any mental disorder might ever turn violent; the vast majority never do, even those who make threats and preparations to do so. Most people who go through these steps never act out in a violent way, never go beyond contemplation of it, said <span class=Person>J. Reid Meloy</span>, a forensic psychologist in <span class=City>San Diego</span> and an <span class=JobTitle>editor</span> of the <span class=PrintMedia>International Handbook of Threat Assessment</span>. You cant predict who will and who wont.</p> <p>Peter Rodger told a friend the other day that his son had been an enigma to the family  distant, remote, unknowable. Hes such a good liar that I didnt even know he knew how to lie, the friend recalled the father saying. Yet throughout his teenage years, friends of the boy and his family saw signs that something was wrong.</p> <p><span class=Person>Simon Astaire</span>, an author and agent who has been a family friend for over 10 years and has been acting as the familys spokesman, described attending a <span class=Holiday>Christmas</span> party at Peter Rodgers hillside home in <span class=City>Woodland Hills</span> and wandering out into the cool night to come across Elliot, then 12, staring into the black sky. He said Elliot had lowered his head and started sharing his loneliness before turning back wordlessly toward the heavens.</p> <p>He wasnt just a little withdrawn, <span class=Keyword>Mr. Astaire</span> said. He was as withdrawn as any person I ever met in my life.</p> <p><span class=Person>Cathleen Bloeser</span>, whose son knew Elliot from <span class=Organization>elementary school</span>, described him as an emotionally troubled boy who would come over to their house and just hide. If I could have picked anyone who would have done this, it would have been Elliot, she said. My husband and I didnt want our son to stay with Elliot.</p> <p>He fled two high schools after begging his parents, in tears, to rescue him from what he described as a bullying environment. When he was a sophomore, a school <span class=JobTitle>administrator</span> said, he suffered a panic attack  standing immobilized in the hallway  until a teacher went outside to ask his mother, waiting in a car, to come get him. He apparently never returned to the school.</p> <p>The older he got, the more his <span class=Keyword>parents</span> worried about his future.</p> <p>They were concerned: Could he be easily taken advantage of? Could he be an easy target for some kind of a scam or whatever? said <span class=Person>Deborah Smith</span>, a <span class=Organization>Los Angeles high school</span> principal who encountered <span class=Keyword>Mr. Rodger</span> at two of the schools he attended. Would he be able to navigate the world on his own?</p> <p>He seemed to have grown only more withdrawn after he left home for college. After <span class=Keyword>Mr. Rodger</span> returned to his apartment one night after being beaten up at a party  he had, by his account, tried to shove a girl off a ledge  Chris Pollard, a neighbor, sought to calm him.</p> <p>He started saying: Im going to kill them. Im going to kill them. Im going to kill myself, Mr. Pollard recalled.</p> <p>Eleven months later, <span class=Keyword>Mr. Rodger</span> acted on that pledge.</p> <p>Torment in Schools</p> <p>Ms. Smith, the principal at <span class=Organization>Independence Continuation High School</span> in Van Nuys, a <span class=Keyword>small public school</span> with intensive individual attention from which <span class=Keyword>Mr. Rodger</span> eventually graduated, awoke May 24 to the reports of the massacre and, later that Saturday, a text message from a teacher: Did you see the news? it asked. Thats our Elliot.</p> <p>Mr. Rodgers <span class=Keyword>parents</span> sent him to Independence as a sophomore, but it was already his third high school. He had begun at <span class=Organization>Crespi Carmelite High School</span>, an <span class=Keyword>all-boys Catholic school</span> in Encino. In a 140-page account of his life that <span class=Keyword>Mr. Rodger</span> sent out by email right before the killings, he recalled bursting with excitement at the prospect.</p> <p>But that turned to dread the first day his father drove him to school and he spotted the huge <span class=Keyword>high school</span> students walking around. I cried in the car for a few minutes, telling my father that I was scared to get out, he wrote.</p> <p>Before long, he withdrew from class work into <span class=FieldTerminology>World of Warcraft</span>, the <span class=Keyword>online interactive video</span> game that had become his obsession. He waited for the halls to clear before walking to class. They threw food at me during lunchtime and after school, he wrote. What kind of horrible, depraved people would poke fun at a boy younger than them who has just entered high school?</p> <p>His <span class=Keyword>parents</span> removed him at the end of the year, and sent him to <span class=Organization>Taft Charter High School</span>, a <span class=Keyword>2,700-student public school</span> in <span class=City>Woodland Hills</span>. Almost immediately, he complained of being shoved against lockers and belittled by other boys in front of girls. <span class=Keyword>Ms. Smith</span> was working as a behavioral specialist for the school district and was assigned to help Mr. Rodger. One afternoon, she said, he was seized by an anxiety attack as he tried to leave school, stopping dead in his tracks in a hallway.</p> <p>He panicked, she said. He just couldnt move.</p> <p>Ms. Smith said she did not recall ever seeing him at the school again. We tried to get him to go back, but we were not successful, she said. It was too big, too overwhelming for him.</p> <p>He moved to Independence, a school of about 100 students with just three or four hours of instruction a day and a mission to help troubled children. The boy hardly spoke, spending even more time immersed in his video game; at home, he fought with his stepmother when she told him to get offline.</p> <p>Ms. Smith, who became the <span class=Degree>principal of Independence</span> the year <span class=Keyword>Mr. Rodger</span> was a junior, said he had displayed classic symptoms of Aspergers syndrome: He was socially awkward, had trouble making eye contact and was very withdrawn, if very smart. Sometimes at lunch, kids would encourage him to join their tables, she said. Sometimes he would. But even when he did, he would just kind of be present.</p> <p>His longest conversations seemed to be with one of the special-education assistants, with whom he would discuss <span class=FieldTerminology>World of Warcraft</span>.</p> <p>He had this push and pull between his desire to engage socially and his fear of rejection, <span class=Keyword>Ms. Smith</span> said.</p> <p>Yet he was liked at Independence. <span class=Keyword>Ms. Smith</span> said that some of the students had felt protective of him, and that staff members had referred to him as our Elliot.</p> <p>They lost track of him after he graduated and headed to Pierce College, one of a series of colleges he attended before landing in <span class=City>Isla Vista</span>. About a year later, <span class=Keyword>Ms. Smith</span> said, the boys <span class=Keyword>parents</span> sent an email with an upbeat report on Elliot. It was the last time anyone gave our Elliot much thought, until he emerged 10 days ago, defined by his 140-page manifesto and videos.</p> <p>Thats not the kid that I knew, <span class=Keyword>Ms. Smith</span> said. He presented as very innocent, very soft-spoken. He never even raised his voice.</p> <p>Vagaries of Hollywood</p> <p>At first glance, <span class=Keyword>Elliot Rodger</span> appeared to be a privileged son of Hollywood  the red-carpet movie premieres, the $500 Neiman Marcus sweaters, the Armani shirts and the Gucci sunglasses, the <span class=Company>BMW</span>. He was one of two children from the marriage; he had a younger sister. But divorce filings and interviews suggest a life colored less by Hollywood glamour than by the boom-and-bust cycle that came with his fathers career as a freelance photographer and director.</p> <p>Peter Rodger worked often on television commercials and spent a few days directing extra shots for The Hunger Games, a job that got Elliot a seat at the movies splashy premiere two years ago. Elliot Rodgers stepmother, Soumaya Akaaboune, is an actress who last year had a small role in Lovelace, an independent film. Its executive producers included John Thompson, who was among the show business acquaintances mentioned in his manifesto.</p> <p>His mother, <span class=Person>Li Chin</span>, was a unit nurse on the 1989 film Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, for which George Lucas was an executive producer; that connection gave her son an entree to other red-carpet premieres. He boasted in his manifesto that his mother was a friend of Steven Spielbergs and even dated <span class=Keyword>Mr. Lucas</span> briefly. (Representatives of <span class=Keyword>Mr. Lucas</span> and Mr. Spielberg had no comment when queried about the connections last week.)</p> <p>Peter Rodgers career directing commercials was jolted when the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks depressed the industry. In a quest that was partly spiritual and partly a failed business venture, friends said, he decided to make a documentary. He visited 23 countries in two and a half years, shooting a film in which he asked people as famous as <span class=Person>Ringo Starr</span> and as obscure as Asian schoolchildren a single question: What is God?</p> <p>The film, Oh My God, sold only a handful of tickets when released in November 2009 and cost <span class=Keyword>Peter Rodger</span> as much as $200,000 of his own money, drawn from equity in a home, according to his ex-wifes court filings, in addition to years of lost income. If only my failure of a father had made better decisions with his directing career instead wasting his money on that stupid documentary, his son wrote.</p> <p>During this period, the boys family seemed to be trying all the more frantically to help him. His mom did everything she could to help Elliot, said Philip Bloeser, who attended Topanga <span class=Keyword>Elementary Charter School</span> with him. Mr. Astaire, the family friend and spokesman, said that whenever he visited, his first question was about Elliots well-being. He said he had once explicitly asked <span class=Keyword>Peter Rodger</span> whether the boy could prove a threat to the public, and had been assured no. Still, <span class=Keyword>Mr. Astaire</span> said, he always worried that Elliot would one day take his own life.</p> <p>While his <span class=Keyword>parents</span> saw a loner who would not leave his room, the manifesto and videos show a far more agitated young man. <span class=Keyword>Mr. Rodger</span> wrote of feeling tortured as he pined for young blondes and of heading out to a mall to buy designer clothes that he thought would make him more appealing. At one point, he set about to become a millionaire, planning a scheme to win the lottery and making several trips to <span class=StateOrCounty>Arizona</span>, where he spent hundreds of dollars trying to win the Powerball jackpot.</p> <p>He described seeing two hot blonde girls waiting at a bus stop. He flashed a smile at them and was ignored. In a rage, he wrote, I made a U-turn, pulled up to their bus stop and splashed my Starbucks latte all over them. I felt a feeling of spiteful satisfaction as I saw it stain their jeans.</p> <p>Mr. Rodger also wrote of watching a flock of beautiful blonde girls playing kickball one day with fraternity jocks in a public park. The sight so enraged him that he drove to a local Kmart and purchased a water gun, filling it with orange juice. He described what happened next, after he returned to the park: I screamed at them with rage as I sprayed them with my super soaker.</p> <p>The obsessively detailed self-published account of his life inevitably raises questions of how much was real and how much was hopelessly distorted by the filter of illness. Still, its writing is clear and precise. It has none of the raving quality that you see in the writing of people with psychosis, such as Jared L. Loughner, who opened fire on Representative Gabrielle Giffords in <span class=StateOrCounty>Arizona</span> in 2011, said Dr. Michael Stone, a New York forensic psychiatrist who looked at the manuscript but has no connection to the family.</p> <p>Retreating Into the Internet</p> <p>In his last years in <span class=City>Isla Vista</span>, <span class=Keyword>Mr. Rodger</span> had stopped going to classes and his life appeared to be conducted entirely online. There had always been <span class=FieldTerminology>World of Warcraft</span>, but now there were posts on sites that drew sexually frustrated young men  including PUAhate, an online forum where participants ranted against pickup artists who had more success with women.</p> <p>On PUAhate, a site that was taken down after the murders, <span class=Keyword>Mr. Rodger</span> expressed his disgust at women, questioning how they could resist his charms. He would urge other incels  or involuntary celibates  to fight back. One day incels will realize their true strength and numbers, and will overthrow this oppressive feminist system, he wrote. Start envisioning a world where WOMEN FEAR YOU.</p> <p>The videos he posted on YouTube and Facebook were theatrical, even hammy, with him narrating scenic drives under palm trees, winking at the camera as he bobbed his head to bouncy songs like Walking on Sunshine  all to demonstrate to women how absurd it was that they did not find him alluring. They should be on me, he wrote.</p> <p>Others in Mr. Rodgers new community sometimes expressed solidarity with him, but soon turned on him: He was attacked as desperate, insecure, pretentious, entitled, bitter and whiny. And at times, as happened in high school, they mocked him for his small stature. (He was, by his account, 5 feet 9 inches tall and 135 pounds.) One taunted him as an average looking manlet, provoking a response from Mr. Rodger.</p> <p>I am a drop-dead gorgeous, fabulous, stylish, exotic gem among thousands of rocks, he wrote.</p> <p>As Mr. Rodgers Day of Retribution, as he called it, approached, there were signs of what he was plotting. One poster on Bodybuilding.com, another website where he shared his views, noted that <span class=Keyword>Mr. Rodger</span> had taken down a video titled Why Do Girls Hate Me So Much? This person said the video had made him look like a serial killer. Im not trying to be mean, but the creepy vibe that you give off in those videos is likely the major reason that you cant get girls, he wrote.</p> <p>Mr. Rodgers response now seems particularly chilling.</p> <p>My <span class=Keyword>parents</span> discovered the videos, so I temporarily took them down, he wrote. They will be back up in a few days, along with more videos Ive filmed.</p> <p>On the night of the killings, members of Mr. Rodgers online world instantly drew the connection between the violence in <span class=City>Isla Vista</span> and the man they had been jousting with online.</p> <p>Could someone tip off the police just in case? one wrote, even as six people had already died at Mr. Rodgers hand.</p> <p>Why? another asked.</p> <p>Dont, someone else posted. Whatever happens. We didnt do anything so just let it happen if it does.</p>",Elliot O. Rodgers Killings in California Followed Years of Withdrawal - NYTimes.com,6/2/14,"Elliot O.

A campaign promising free shotguns for people in Tucson's most troubled neighborhoods has divided some residents in a community still reeling from a shooting rampage in 2011 that killed six people, left a congresswoman and several others wounded, and made the city a symbol of <span class=Keyword>gun violence</span> in <span class=Continent>America</span>.</p> <p>The nonprofit <span class=Organization>Armed Citizen Project</span> is part of a national campaign to give shotguns to <span class=Keyword>single women</span> and homeowners in neighborhoods with high-crime rates. The effort comes amid a national debate on <span class=Keyword>gun control</span> after mass shootings in <span class=StateOrCounty>Arizona</span>, <span class=StateOrCounty>Colorado</span> and <span class=StateOrCounty>Connecticut</span>.</p> <p>While towns in <span class=StateOrCounty>Idaho</span>, <span class=StateOrCounty>Utah</span>, <span class=StateOrCounty>Virginia</span> and Pennsylvania have debated ordinances recommending gun ownership, the <span class=Keyword>gun giveaway</span> effort appears to be the first of its kind.</p> <p>""If you are not willing to protect the citizens of Tucson, someone is going to do it, why not me? Why not have armed citizens protecting themselves,"" said Shaun <span class=Company>McClusky</span>, a <span class=FieldTerminology>real estate agent</span> who plans to start handing out shotguns by May.</p> <p><span class=StateOrCounty>Arizona</span> gun proponents have donated about $12,500 to fund the <span class=Keyword>gun giveaway</span> and <span class=Company>McClusky</span>, a former mayoral and city council candidate, hopes to collect enough to eventually arm entire neighborhoods.</p> <p>Participants will receive training on how to properly use, handle and store their weapon, as well as trigger locks. It costs about $400 per participant for the weapon and training.</p> <p>Tucson police officials declined to discuss the <span class=Keyword>gun program</span> or <span class=Keyword>public safety</span> concerns, but statistics published by the department show violent crime was at a 13-year low in 2010, with 3,332 incidents. That compares with 5,116 violent crimes  including homicides, sexual assaults, and robberies  in 1997. Tucson averages about 50 homicides a year.</p> <p>""Just like any other city in <span class=StateOrCounty>Arizona</span> and in the nation we have our issues, but it is not crime-ridden,"" said <span class=Person>Vice Mayor Regina Romero</span>. ""I would never say you have to carry a gun or you have to be afraid for your life.""</p> <p>Research has produced inconclusive results on whether defensive <span class=Keyword>gun use lowers</span> crime. Some research suggests guns result in more suicides and accidental deaths, while other studies have shown criminals are wary of gun owners.</p> <p>""People don't want to confront an armed person at home,"" said <span class=Person>Garen J. Wintemute</span>, director of the Violence <span class=Keyword>Prevention Research Program</span> at the <span class=Organization>University of California</span>, <span class=City>Davis</span>. ""But, separately, there is solid evidence that in communities with higher rates of gun ownership, <span class=Crime>burglary</span> rates are up, not down, and that's because guns are hot loot.""</p> <p>Wintemute said it's likely the risk of violence in the homes participating in the <span class=Keyword>gun giveaway</span> will go up.</p> <p>But those behind the program argue shotguns are affordable, easy to use and don't require precise aim when shooting, making them the perfect home protection weapon. The goal is to arm hundreds of people in Tucson, <span class=City>Houston</span>, New York, Chicago, Detroit and at least 10 other cities by the end of the year.</p> <p>""It is our hypothesis that criminals have no desire to die in your hallway. We want to use that fear,"" said Kyle Coplen, 29, the project's <span class=JobTitle>founder</span> and a University of <span class=City>Houston</span> graduate student.</p> <p>Tucson became a symbol of <span class=Continent>America</span>n's <span class=Keyword>gun violence</span> in 2011 when a mentally ill man opened fire at a political meet-and-greet hosted by then-Rep. <span class=Person>Gabrielle Giffords</span> outside a Tucson-area supermarket. Giffords, who is still recovering from her critical wounds, has in recent months become a champion of <span class=Keyword>universal background gun</span> checks and other <span class=Keyword>gun restrictions</span> denounced by <span class=FieldTerminology>Second Amendment</span> proponents.</p> <p>Moved by Giffords' advocacy, the <span class=Organization>Tucson City Council</span> recently approved a measure requiring background checks at <span class=Keyword>gun shows</span> held on city property. City officials said the <span class=Keyword>gun giveaway</span> program appears to be legal, so they have no recourse to shut it down.</p> <p>One of the neighborhoods targeted by the program is <span class=Facility>Pueblo Gardens</span>, an ethnically diverse, blue-collar neighborhood in southern Tucson where residents say occasional shootings, drug busts and car thefts are not uncommon.</p> <p>The no-frills landscape is dotted with pickup trucks, palm trees, window bars, cacti, chain fences and toy-littered lawns. Many residents own guns, if only because of the handful of sex offenders who call the area home. More than 90 percent of the humble, single-story homes are occupied by renters.</p> <p><span class=Facility>Pueblo Gardens</span> could benefit from a <span class=Keyword>public safety</span> campaign, but some residents say they are appalled anyone would think the answer is more guns.</p> <p>""We could take that $400 per shotgun and give it to these people so they could go buy groceries, pay rent, pay their utility bills, something useful,"" said neighborhood association <span class=JobTitle>president</span> Cindy Ayala. ""Vigilantism is not the answer.""</p> <p><span class=Company>McClusky</span> argued that like signs posted in yards advertising alarm systems, signs that warn the homeowners have guns would get the message across, he said.</p> <p>""I'd like to prevent them from becoming a victim,"" he said.</p> <p>At least 13 <span class=Keyword>single women</span> in <span class=City>Houston</span> have already benefited from the program.</p> <p><span class=Person>Tiffany Braggs</span>, 44, said she had never owned or fired a gun before she signed up for The <span class=Organization>Armed Citizen Project</span> in <span class=City>Houston</span> after her condominium management board warned residents of growing crime.</p> <p>""I feel a little bit more secure knowing that I can defend my home and my children,"" said Braggs, who now plans to buy a handgun to keep in her purse.</p> <p><span class=Person>Alan M. Gottlieb</span>, <span class=JobTitle>founder</span> of the <span class=Organization><span class=FieldTerminology>Second Amendment</span> Foundation</span> in Bellevue, Wash., said he expects to see more <span class=Keyword>gun giveaways</span> as President <span class=Person>Barack Obama</span> and other leaders call for gun restrictions.</p> <p>""All this is happening because it's a pushback,"" he said.

I'm a <span class=Keyword>Life Member</span> and I try to get there every year. But this year is different. If I showed up you'd tried to get me to help you fight a ""culture war."" But if there is a war going on, you represent the wrong side.</p> <p>I just watched your speech. I think it's time you dropped this nonsense about protecting our ""rights."" Be honest and tell it like it is. The reason you're opposed to <span class=Keyword>background checks</span> has absolutely nothing to do with the <span class=FieldTerminology>Second Amendment</span>. It's about making it as easy as possible for everyone to own a gun. More guns means more profits for the gun companies, and that's who you really represent.</p> <p>In 2011, <span class=Company>Ruger</span>'s stock was trading at <span class=Quantity>$21</span> a share, now it's at <span class=Quantity>$51</span>. <span class=Company>Smith & Wesson</span>'s stock was three bucks a share, today it's almost nine. I remember after the <span class=Keyword>2010 elections</span> when it looked like the <span class=Organization>Obama administration</span> was going to be toast, <span class=Keyword>gun dealers</span> like myself couldn't give away the inventory. Now we can't keep anything on the shelves. You keep referring to the <span class=JobTitle>president</span> as an enemy of the gun industry. The truth is that <span class=Person>Barack Obama</span> is the best <span class=JobTitle>salesman</span> the industry ever had.</p> <p>And the reason he's such a good <span class=JobTitle>salesman</span>, <span class=Person>Wayne</span>, is because you and your allies have spent the last <span class=Quantity>20 years</span> making every gun owner believe that the only reason we have any <span class=Keyword>gun laws</span> at all is because the <span class=City>Washington</span> ""elites"" want to take away all our guns. So when a tragedy like <span class=Facility><span class=Person>Sandy Hook</span></span> occurs and <span class=Keyword>well-meaning people</span> react to such <span class=Keyword>senseless violence</span> by looking for ways to make it harder for guns to get into the wrong hands, you and the other ""protectors"" of the <span class=FieldTerminology>Second Amendment</span> get right to work convincing responsible <span class=Keyword>gun owners</span> that such laws are aimed at them.  You are protecting illegal and ""irresponsible"" gun owners, and lumping them in with the majority of legal <span class=Keyword>gun owners</span> who are careful with their weapons. That's because an irresponsible gun owners' money is just as good for <span class=Keyword>gun companies</span> as a responsible gun owner, and you want to protect your market share, even at the expense of innocent lives.</p> <p>It's easy to cloak yourself in a <span class=Keyword>holier-than-thou mantle</span> of <span class=Keyword>God-given rights</span> to avoid looking at the facts. And the facts are that private-citizen vigilantism doesn't protect anyone from gun violence; it actually results in more violence and deaths. It's easy to disparage the <span class=Quantity>90 percent</span> of Americans who are in favor of expanding <span class=Keyword>background checks</span> by telling your audience that some unnamed <span class=JobTitle>Congressman</span> from some <span class=Keyword>unnamed state</span> hasn't gotten any calls. But maybe the time has finally come when most Americans are more worried about ending the 100,000+ <span class=Keyword>firearm deaths</span> and injuries than whether you and your <span class=Organization>NRA</span> cult of followers can Stand and Fight.</p> <p>For all your talk about defending liberty <span class=Person>Wayne</span>, I'll give you something more important to defend:  the young children whose lives always seem to take a back seat to how many guns you can get Americans to buy. I'm talking about children at <span class=Facility><span class=Person>Sandy Hook</span></span>, a <span class=Quantity>4-year</span>-old in <span class=City>New York</span>, a <span class=Quantity>2-year</span>-old in <span class=StateOrCounty>Kentucky</span>. There's something immoral about denying any connection between the deaths of children and the explosion in <span class=Keyword>gun sales</span> that you claim show how much we love our freedom. I'd rather have those kids alive, even if it costs me more than a few bucks in gun sales. I joined Evolve so I could be part of an organization that wants <span class=Keyword>gun owners</span> and non-gun owners to lead with solutions that can talk about <span class=Keyword>saving human lives</span> and preserving our <span class=FieldTerminology>Second Amendment</span> rights.

Their neighbor called <span class=Keyword>police</span> as the <span class=Keyword>man</span> climbed out the vehicles sunroof and raced into the streets. He pulled on the door handles of several vehicles parked nearby.</p> <p>He apparently broke into a home on the block and, with <span class=Person>Oakview</span> and <span class=City>Gladstone</span> <span class=Keyword>police</span> surrounding <span class=FieldTerminology>the house</span>, started a <span class=Keyword>vehicle</span> and barreled out through the garage door, said <span class=Organization><span class=City>Kansas City</span> Police</span> <span class=Person>Capt.

He then drove the smashed truck into the <span class=Keyword>neighborhood</span> on North Garfield, where he abandoned it.</p> <p>As he walked away from the truck, the <span class=Keyword>man</span> encountered <span class=Person>Vince Frew</span>, who was sitting in his work <span class=Keyword>van</span> in his driveway about 5:15 a.m.</p> <p>Get out of your car, man! the <span class=Keyword>stranger</span> said, pulling <span class=Keyword>Frew</span> out of the seat. The <span class=Keyword>stranger</span> then demanded the vans <span class=Keyword>keys</span> but didnt show a gun.</p> <p>Frew clutched the vans <span class=Keyword>keys</span> in his hand behind a notebook and told the <span class=Keyword>stranger</span> he didnt have the keys. He said he was just putting some items into his van.</p> <p>The <span class=Keyword>stranger</span> asked if he had another car. <span class=Keyword>Frew</span> said he did not.</p> <p>Frew backed toward his front steps as the <span class=Keyword>stranger</span> rifled through the <span class=Keyword>van</span> in a feeble attempt to find the keys. The <span class=Keyword>stranger</span> spoke fast, his words slurred. <span class=Keyword>Frew</span> wondered if he was under the influence of alcohol or drugs.</p> <p>At one point, the <span class=Keyword>stranger</span> grabbed a cellphone charger from the <span class=Keyword>van</span> and pointed it at Frew, with the cord dangling below, as if it were a weapon. He again demanded the keys.</p> <p>The <span class=Keyword>stranger</span> later approached <span class=Keyword>Frew</span> and patted his pockets, looking for the keys. <span class=Keyword>Frew</span> pushed him away.</p> <p>Frustrated, the <span class=Keyword>stranger</span> grabbed something from the <span class=Keyword>van</span> and threw it at Frew, hitting Frews arm. <span class=Keyword>Frew</span> cursed the <span class=Keyword>stranger</span> and started walking toward him. Thats when the <span class=Keyword>stranger</span> gave up and ran away.</p> <p>Frew then opened his <span class=Keyword>garage door</span> and slipped inside. He noticed the <span class=Keyword>stranger</span> turned around at the sound of the garage opening. <span class=Keyword>Frew</span> closed his garage, called 911, retrieved his gun and stepped back onto his front porch.</p> <p>But the <span class=Keyword>stranger</span> was gone. <span class=Keyword>Frew</span> saw an <span class=JobTitle>officer</span> drive by, then heard a gunshot a few doors down. Then a second gunshot.</p> <p>Three more <span class=Keyword>police</span> cars converged in the cul-de-sac just southwest of Frews home.</p> <p>Frew later learned his neighbor had shot the stranger.</p> <p>Neighbor <span class=Person>Gina Smeja</span> said she has lived in the <span class=Keyword>neighborhood</span> for more than <span class=Quantity>four years</span> with no problems until last week when someone broke into vehicles.

Mark Ormsby</span> said.</p> <p>The victim, identified only as a man in his 50s, was found unresponsive in his car at 4:38 a.m. with major <span class=Keyword>head trauma</span> after crashing his car over <span class=Keyword>concrete car</span> stops and into a tree.</p> <p>While the incident was initially reported as a car crash, <span class=Keyword>doctors</span> who examined the man at the <span class=Keyword>hospital</span> discovered that the man had also been shot once in the head, Ormsby said. The man remained in <span class=Keyword>critical condition</span> for about <span class=Quantity>36 hours</span> before he died at the <span class=Keyword>hospital</span> about 3 p.m. Sunday of injuries related to the gunshot wound.</p> <p>According to Ormsby, a <span class=Keyword>police investigation</span> revealed the man may have been lured to the <span class=Keyword>ATM location</span> by a pair of would-be robbers, who planned to steal the man's money when he arrived for a <span class=Keyword>meeting</span> with the two, Ormsby said. While police say they don't know the extent of the relationship between the suspects and the victim, Ormsby said the three had prior contact to arrange the <span class=Keyword>meeting</span> in the parking lot.</p> <p>""It seems kind of odd how everything went down, and we're trying to piece those things together right now,"" Ormsby said. ""They talked to him on the phone and arranged to have a <span class=Keyword>meeting</span> there. What that <span class=Keyword>meeting</span> was for, we still don't know.""</p> <p>The couple made off with nothing in the <span class=Crime>attempted robbery</span> Saturday, according to Ormsby, who would not speculate about whether leaving empty-handed spurred the couple to resort to violence.</p> <p>Both Ericiga and McFall were arrested on <span class=Keyword>suspicion</span> of <span class=Crime>murder</span>, <span class=Keyword>robbery</span> and conspiracy Monday, and remain in custody at <span class=Facility>Santa Rita Jail</span> without bail.

Several gunshots were heard in the area of <span class=FieldTerminology>Third Avenue</span> and South Washington Street. A screaming <span class=Keyword>Duckworth</span> ran shirtless and bloody, trying to get into passing cars and a Metro bus, <span class=TelevisionStation><span class=Company>KIRO</span></span> reported on March 21.""He was scared. You could tell he thought he was going to die,"" a witness told <span class=TelevisionStation><span class=Company>KIRO</span></span> at that time. <span class=Keyword>Duckworth</span> was treated at <span class=Facility>Harborview</span>. He apparently could not tell police who shot him or what happened, <span class=TelevisionStation><span class=Company>KIRO</span></span> reported at the time.</p> <p><span class=City>Seattle</span> police said he has several drug convictions, and was wanted for not reporting to his community corrections <span class=JobTitle>officer</span>.</p> <p>Detectives and <span class=FieldTerminology>crime scene investigators</span> are still sorting out what exactly happened during the two shootings that took place on Monday, said <span class=City>Seattle</span> Acting <span class=FieldTerminology>Police Chief</span> <span class=Person>Jim Pugel</span>. ""There is still a lot we do not know,"" he said.</p> <p>On Monday, the first shooting occurred at 8:48 a.m. when a southbound <span class=Keyword>Metro bus</span> stopped on <span class=FieldTerminology>Third Avenue</span> near Union Street. Three <span class=Keyword>people</span> entered the bus through the rear door instead of the front door where the fare box is. The driver told the three who were apparently not together to reenter through the front door, and two did so.</p> <p>The third man <span class=Keyword>Duckworth</span> began pacing in the middle of the bus and then moved to the front to face the driver. He assaulted the driver, and then shot the man twice with a revolver once in the torso and once in a cheek, Pugel said. The reason for the shooting is still under investigation.</p> <p>The man ran from the Route <span class=Quantity>27 bus</span> while yelling. Two <span class=Keyword>off-duty uniformed police</span> sergeants were nearby. One sergeant attended to the driver and the other began chasing <span class=Keyword>Duckworth</span> with three other <span class=JobTitle>officer</span>s who had just arrived. <span class=Keyword>Duckworth</span> pointed his revolver several times at the <span class=JobTitle>officer</span>s chasing him. It was undetermined Monday whether he fired shots at them. Some reported hearing clicks apparently coming from the pistol.</p> <p>Duckworth tried to get into a service truck and a car while being chased. Then he came to a second <span class=Keyword>Metro bus</span> climbing the hill on Seneca Street where it intersected <span class=FieldTerminology>Third Avenue</span>. ""Somehow, the door came open,"" Pugel said. <span class=Keyword>Duckworth</span> got on, and the driver and several of the roughly 15 passengers got off two bruising themselves in the scramble.</p> <p>Some <span class=Keyword>people</span> were still on the bus when the suspect raised his gun. Officers shot him at least once. He raised his gun again, Pugel said, and <span class=JobTitle>officer</span>s fired again, hitting him at least once more. Information was not available Monday on where the bullets hit Duckworth.</p> <p>""Officers are taught to shoot only if there is a safe background [with no bystanders behind the target],"" Pugel said. So far, the shooting appeared to follow proper procedures since a violent suspect had a gun raised, he said.</p> <p>""The <span class=JobTitle>officer</span>s moved quickly and did their job,"" said <span class=Person>Mayor Mike McGinn</span>.</p> <p>A <span class=Quantity>32-year</span>-old <span class=JobTitle>officer</span> received minor injuries, likely from broken glass,and was taken to <span class=Facility>Harborview</span>. Another <span class=JobTitle>officer</span> in his 50s was also taken there because of a medical condition, police said. Police are checking video cameras on the two buses and looking for cell phone videos.</p> <p>I find it interesting that <span class=Keyword>Duckworth</span> was wanted for not reporting to his community corrections <span class=JobTitle>officer</span>.  This guy was being housed by <span class=Company>Plymouth Housing</span> and getting counseling by <span class=PrintMedia>Sound Mental Health</span>. With oversight by both the police and <span class=Company>Plymouth Housing</span>, why did this happen?  Is the City/County's approach toward working with these <span class=Keyword>violent felons/drug</span> addicts/supposed <span class=Keyword>mental health</span> issues working?  I think not and it is very visible on <span class=City>Seattle</span> streets.  This ""Oh, he's had a hard life, he needs treatment"" just isn't working for me and obviously not working for the City.  Time to take a new approach.</p> <p>Over the weekend I watched a hearing on TVW (Channel 23) before a committee assigned to look into the issues of mental health, addiction problems and hopefully a change in the commitment statutes, hopefully an increase in funds for 2014.  There was testimony by a lot of <span class=Keyword>people</span> -- judges, lawyers, <span class=Keyword>mental health</span> advocates, etc.  One person in particular a Psychologist at <span class=Organization>Western State</span> said that there are certain behaviors (drug and alcohol addiction) that no matter how much treatment is given to <span class=Keyword>people</span> committed to <span class=Organization>Western State</span>, the minute they are released the behavior starts over immediately.  This doctor had <span class=Quantity>20 years</span> of experience with inpatient treatment at <span class=Organization>Western State</span>.  We all know treatment for drug addiction/alcohol only works when the the person wants it.  But what are we doing, trying to save them all -- thanks to the influence of church leaders.</p> <p><span class=Person>Norge</span> said ""I find it interesting that <span class=Keyword>Duckworth</span> was wanted for not reporting to his community corrections <span class=JobTitle>officer</span>.

Deval Patrick</span> ordered the entire city of <span class=City>Boston</span> and some suburbs to stay inside during what he called a massive manhunt, and police began a house-to-house search. <span class=City>Boston</span> <span class=FieldTerminology>shut down</span> its buses and subway system.</p> <p>The <span class=Keyword>suspects</span> are brothers of Chechen origin with the last name Tsarnaev, <span class=FieldTerminology>law enforcement</span> officials told <span class=TelevisionStation>NBC News</span>. The suspect at large, <span class=Person>Dzhokhar Tsarnaev</span>, is 19, was born in <span class=Country>Kyrgyzstan</span> and has a Massachusetts drivers license, they said. The <span class=Keyword>dead suspect</span> was identified as TamerlanTsarnaev, 26, born in <span class=Country>Russia</span>.</p> <p>TamerlanTsarnaev was run over by a vehicle during the firefight, <span class=FieldTerminology>law enforcement</span> officials told <span class=TelevisionStation>NBC News</span>. Law enforcement officials also told <span class=TelevisionStation>NBC News</span> that the brothers entered the <span class=Country>United States</span> with family in 2002 or 2003, and that Tamerlan Tsarnaev became a <span class=Keyword>legal permanent resident</span> in 2007.</p> <p>Watch <span class=Keyword>special live coverage</span> from <span class=TelevisionStation>NBC News</span></p> <p>Suspects in bombings are brothers, authorities say</p> <p>The chaotic sequence of events started six hours after the <span class=Organization>FBI</span> triggered a nationwide manhunt by releasing photos of the suspects, believed responsible for detonating two bombs at the <span class=Keyword>marathon finish line</span> Monday, killing three people and injuring 176.</p> <p>The suspect at large was described by authorities as light-skinned and with <span class=Person>brown</span>, curly hair, and wearing a gray hoodie.</p> <p>There is a terrorist on the loose, a <span class=FieldTerminology>law enforcement</span> <span class=JobTitle>officer</span> said at a press conference before dawn.</p> <p>Police shut a 4-mile stretch of streets between <span class=City>Cambridge</span>, <span class=StateOrCounty>Mass.</span>, and <span class=City>Watertown</span> because they could be littered with unexploded devices, and they began a door-to-door search in <span class=City>Watertown</span>. A convoy of at least 20 vehicles, including military-style humvees and buses, was seen descending on the town.</p> <p>More than 1 million people in <span class=City>Boston</span> and the suburbs were ordered to stay inside and lock their doors.</p> <p>I just want to speak to the community of <span class=City>Watertown</span>. We need your help now. We are asking everyone to shelter into your place, <span class=City>Watertown</span> Police Chief <span class=Person>Edward Deveau</span> said.

He said that he saw the <span class=Keyword>suspects</span> use what looked like a pressure-cooker bomb.</p> <p>I saw them light this bomb. They threw it towards the <span class=JobTitle>officer</span>s, he said. It created a significant decoy, and there was smoke that covered our entire street.</p> <p>Investigators believe at least one of the two bombs that exploded at the <span class=Keyword>marathon finish line</span> was housed in an ordinary kitchen <span class=FieldTerminology>pressure cooker</span>.</p> <p>Police with guns drawn search for a suspect on April 19, 2013 in <span class=City>Watertown</span>, <span class=StateOrCounty>Mass.</span> Earlier, a <span class=Organization>Massachusetts Institute of Technology</span> campus police <span class=JobTitle>officer</span> was shot and killed <span class=Keyword>late Thursday night</span> at the school's campus in <span class=City>Cambridge</span>. A short time later, police reported exchanging gunfire with alleged carjackers in <span class=City>Watertown</span>, a city near <span class=City>Cambridge</span>. It's not clear whether the shootings are related or whether either are related to the <span class=City>Boston</span> Marathon bombing.</p> <p>President <span class=Person>Barack Obama</span> was briefed overnight on the events, a <span class=Keyword>White House official</span> told <span class=TelevisionStation>NBC News</span>. On Thursday, he spoke at a prayer service for the marathon victims and vowed that the people responsible would be caught.</p> <p>Law enforcement officials said the tumult began just before 11 p.m., when the <span class=Keyword>suspects</span> approached a police <span class=JobTitle>officer</span> from the <span class=Organization>Massachusetts Institute of Technology</span> and shot him in the head.</p> <p>The two then stole the <span class=JobTitle>officer</span>s cruiser, robbed a nearby 7-Eleven, carjacked a Mercedes SUV and briefly kidnapped the driver, the sources said. The <span class=Keyword>suspects</span> threw explosives out the window during the chase that followed, they said. A <span class=City>Boston</span> transit police <span class=JobTitle>officer</span> was shot and wounded, authorities said.</p> <p>The <span class=Keyword>dead suspect</span>  the man in the black hat from the <span class=Organization>FBI</span> photos  had an improvised explosive device strapped to his chest, <span class=FieldTerminology>law enforcement</span> officials said.</p> <p><span class=City>Kitzenberg</span> said that the firefight ended when one of the shooters ran toward the <span class=City>Watertown</span> <span class=JobTitle>officer</span>s and ultimately fell to the ground. <span class=City>Kitzenberg</span> said he could not tell whether the man was tackled or had been shot.</p> <p>The other drove the SUV through a line of police offcers at the end of the street, he said. A bullet from the gunbattle lodged in the wall of <span class=City>Kitzenberg</span>s apartment, he said.</p> <p><span class=City>Kitzenberg</span> said that while he had a clear view of the shooters, he could not see their faces. He described them as average size, average height.</p> <p>We heard a loud blast and we didn't know what it was, said Rebecca Carbone, who stepped out of her home when she heard sirens. It sounded like a car backfiring.</p> <p><span class=Person>John Grimes</span>, a retired letter carrier, said that he heard three loud explosions, and you dont hear explosions at night a lot.</p> <p>This is a developing story.

Since Scott is listed in living in <span class=City>Durham</span>, not at 102 Christopher Rd., how is everyone coming to the conclusion that the homeowner/resident shot anyone? All the <span class=FieldTerminology>press release</span> says regarding the shooting is ""<span class=Organization><span class=City>Chapel Hill</span> Police Officers</span> were dispatched to a residence on Christopher Road, and a report of a breaking and entering and that someone had been shot. When officers arrived, they found a male that had been shot, and he was transported by <span class=StateOrCounty>Orange County</span> EMS to <span class=Facility>UNC hospital</span>. His condition is unknown at this time. The <span class=Keyword>person shot</span> is not the resident."" nothing about the homeowner having a gun or shooting... While a healthy debate about <span class=Keyword>gun control</span> is fine, we don't want to jump to conclusions too quickly and assume the homeowner even owns or has ever used a gun.</p> <p>1.) The poster said <span class=Keyword>gun ownership</span> not gun crime. And ownership is very low in the <span class=Country>UK</span> and most of <span class=Continent>Europe</span> and <span class=Continent>Asia</span>. Even the cops don't carry guns there most of the time. So their statement is correct.</p> <p>2.) Even if you are talking about <span class=Keyword>gun crime</span> and <span class=Crime>murder</span> by guns, the <span class=Country>UK</span> is nowhere near as high as the <span class=Country>US</span>. Ex.) In 2009 there were over 9000 gun <span class=Crime>murder</span>s in the <span class=Country>US</span> vs ONLY 39 in the <span class=Country>UK</span>. Even if you multiply that by 5 to compensate for the <span class=Keyword>population difference</span> that is still only 195!!</p> <p>This is even lower in countries like <span class=Country>Japan</span>. Gun control can work to lower the <span class=Country>US</span> <span class=Crime>murder</span> rate if properly implemented. Growing up in a miilitary family that was stationed overseas a lot, it was easy to see the difference. You just felt safer.</p> <p>And thanks for making the very <span class=Keyword>good comparision</span> with illegal immigrants. Clearly we would have far far far more immigrants if we didn't have laws on on the books to limit them.....does it keep thenm all out? no.  but it keeps most out.</p>",Man charged in fatal shooting at Chapel Hill home :: WRAL.com,5/30/14,"Lew Hahn Hood, Bartholomew Romidas Scott","Chapel Hill, Durham","Orange County, N.C.",,,,NC,,,on,,,,,,,,,Chapel Hill,14-May,1,,1,102 Christopher Road,,,,,35,male,Bartholomew Romidas Scott,unknown,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,unknown,unknown,Unknown,,,,,,,,33,male,unknown,yes,yes,Lew Hahn Hood,unknown,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
