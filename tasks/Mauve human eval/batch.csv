This idea is called tree substitution, and it offers the following benefits: tree plantations create new wood resources, decreasing production costs for wood per acre. The good news is that this could be easily done and ecologically beneficial forest species can be established, making them more attractive for farmers to plant and transplant. Given the relatively small increase in deforestation resulting from replacement trees, this would mean that tree substitution would lead to near zero deforestation, saving about 1 million tonnes of CO 2 per year. We know that eliminating all deforestation yields zero carbon emissions; one would need to eliminate deforestation before we could reduce emissions even for the benefits of alternative forest growth and maintenance. This is what looks good on paper, but actually works if the cost of supporting forest species is calculated with ecologically sound trade-offs in land use and ecosystem impacts. Any amount of deforestation (including steady or rapid removal of trees in tropical rain forests) also creates carbon dioxide that we have to absorb into the atmosphere.

Both questions can be answered by anyone. Even though you may have a breast shape that many women would consider flat, sometimes you need to be more specific to compare the fit of a bra. However, a general shape feature, while useful, often results in making an action, such as a misshapen breast, very difficult. In particular, wide-set bras may be some of the easiest bras to fit due to their &quot;flat&quot; shape, but if the shape of the &quot;flat&quot; breast makes those questions less relevant, that, too, can be an issue.
