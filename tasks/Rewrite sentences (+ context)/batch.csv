Not really sure can anyone help thanks .,"...You need to know the tank buoyancy characteristics , which are usually published somewhere by the manufacturer . I do n't know much about Faber , but it seems that the buoyancy of the 100 cu ft tank varies by model so you would have to know which one you are dealing with .

The lower pressure Faber 100 is much heavier in the water , so you would be able to shed 11 or 12 lbs from your belt ( difference of 11.46 lbs ) .
