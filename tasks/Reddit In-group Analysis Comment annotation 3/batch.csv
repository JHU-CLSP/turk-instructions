Basically its the same thing as bulking, except for my sport in college (shot put/discus) it wasn't really necessary to avoid the added fat that came with it so I could also retain all of the added strength. Generally what most people do during bulking is eat a lot more calories (healthy ones) than usual which aids in the development of muscles. They'll typically gain 20 pounds (just an example) of muscle and fat, then lose 5-10 pounds because its easier than just trying to gain pure muscle.   As long as your testosterone is well into male ranges and you're taking in enough protein, it probably shouldn't be an issue to put on weight and muscle.

This doesn't make sense. They stop paying for her insurance just because she's pregnant?   School employees are often paid for 180 days or whatever but the pay is spread out over 12 months. I don't see what being pregnant has to do with this.   No paid maternity leave sucks, but it is what it is. If she isn't working, she won't get paid. But I'm not clear on how long this will actually be. Can she just take an unpaid month, let everything heal and go back to work?

The machines rely on outdated technology  some of it is from the 1990s  to calibrate the touch screens. And the hardware is starting to wear out.  &gt;""Over time, as people vote, that calibration becomes less and less accurate,"" says Norden. So by the end of a long day of voting, the machines aren't as accurate as they were in the morning. Also, the sealant that attaches the screen to the machine can deteriorate over time, which causes the screen to be misaligned.  https://www.npr.org/2016/10/26/499450796/some-machines-are-flipping-votes-but-that-doesnt-mean-theyre-rigged",0.883206526,Notreallymeatall99,"(throw away account for obvious reasons)  Get your testosterone levels checked.

Fast forward to when our kids are 7 &amp; 9, we were both 40 and there were no more excuses -- and I was as sexually frustrated as you could ever imagine.   Finally convinced him to get tested--his levels were very low. He's now using Androgel and his levels are right where they should be and he's much happier overall. His energy levels and mood are much better, as is his sex drive.  I'm not sure how common is it--and he may have had other reasons for it, given that he's a testicular cancer survivor and either that fact or the radiation he received may have contributed to his low testosterone levels.

When she was going to school she was 100% focused on school and pretty much completely ignored me the entire time. I cosigned 2 large loans for her so she could go to school. She wanted to go to nursing school for a better job (she worked in a research lab before). I felt very alone the entire time she was in school. She was either at school or studying - never made time for me. We were annoyed with each other constantly. Fast forward she gets her degree starts working. Odds are you will have to work the night shift when starting. I hardly ever saw her anymore. She then started having an affair with a co-worker. I divorced her ass. Nurses have a very high rate of divorce. From what she told me tons of flirting goes on there especially in hospitals with people who work the night shift. Everyone was basically fucking each other.

A little background. I am a 24 year old male and have had gynecomastia for the majority of my life. I decided to investigate my testosterone levels as a result.  Before starting TRT, I checked my testosterone levels 3 times (11.2 nmol/L, 15.2 nmol/L, 11.9 nmol/L) for the last one my free testosterone came in at 225 pmol/L.  These levels are very low for my age, and my physician started me on Androgel (1%) 2.5g packets, once a day (25 mg testosterone). Noticed my testicles were slightly more tender, no real side effects (positive or negative) in terms of libido or energy. I got myself tested again 3 weeks after starting Androgel and my test results came in as 11.5 nmol/L total testosterone and 219 pmol/L free testosterone. These results kind of shocked me, given that they are slight decreases.

Also, those celebrities you are mentioning have nutritionists, dieting coaches, fitness trainers, personal chefs, etc. They are not living the lives majority of weed smokers do.  The point i'm trying to make is, my personal experiences and with observations around me of 100's of 'stoners', i can easily see a trend and not just that, most of the 'stoners' agree to it as well.  And from a scientific perspective, there are many conflicting studies, but none that are really positive, unless it's from the specific compounds isolated for medicinal purposes.

States all handle child support differently. In Oregon, for example, I pay $1500 to the state every month.

I get paid on the 10th and 25th of each month, and she receives her support checks about 8-10 business days later. Neither myself, not my ex wife, have any idea where the other 600 goes, and have both been told by the district attorney that every penny is accounted for and that they'll take legal action of we keep asking about it.

When you're using exogenous testosterone, your body receives a fixed level of testosterone, and you don't have to worry as much about eating enough fats and cholesterol or getting enough sleep. Stress and a bad diet will lower your testosterone levels, but if you're injecting a standard dose each week, then they will have no effect. So in short, a TRT user can get away with a much worse lifestyle than a natty.  Also, some doctors prescribe 150mg or even 200mg of testosterone a week. That puts a man's lowest levels at around 900-1000 ng/dl, which is at the very top of the range.

I fucked the shit out of one of my wifes best friends and she made it known before taking my cock in her mouth its the biggest she ever had.

I do always see her checking me out and flirty when the BF isnt around.

It's better than the 1byOne, but not a lot. I get CW, but it's weak (signal strength in low 40s to 50) and so is Fox and CBS. All three occasionally pixelate the signal, at night, with clear skies. I expect much worse during bad weather. I tried various directions and positions and that's the best I can get. To do anything larger than the 2V will require attic mounting and running cables. I think you're right that I'd need to get different antennas for each band.  For now, I'll be returning the 2V and just sticking with cable. I want to get Comcast out of my life, but at some point, I have to cry ""uncle"" and accept that doing so will cause more disruption than my wife will accept.

I feel bad since they work respectable jobs like scientists and engineers. What really shocked me was a friend said he is not sure about his deposit for a new flat to rent (got kicked out his current place by landlord) because its £1700 and he only has £2k in savings.  He is also 30 :/,0.894298411,jbm222,"I was always a smart kid who never gave a shit about grades.  Basically did just enough homework to learn the material and get A's on the tests.    That said I had about a 3.5 avg through both HS and college and now at 28 yrs old have an individual income somewhere in the top 10% (though not as a tax-filing family since my wife doesnt work).  I love my job, and am comfortable with my income... So a 3.5 was plenty high for me.  Could I be working for Google if I had gotten a 4.0 and a MS?  Probably.  Do I care that I'm not? Not really.  While I'm no pro at it, I've sat on the other side of the table for about 3-4 interviews at my current job.  Never once asked a candidate about their education at all. If you don't have the right résumé, good luck.  Then it only takes about 10 questions to see if you're bullshitting what you claim to know on your resume.  If you are, goodbye.

I learned then that items on the list were put in order of importance and if you don't buy them all, you need to buy them starting at 1 and working down from there.   To someone in their right mind, that would've been a huge red flag. However, I had just lost my dad and got out of a four year relationship.

They used 50 mg/day; I'd personally recommend this dosage at the very least or preferably higher (100150 mg/day). The reason for this is that in a phase II clinical study 50 mg/day bicalutamide monotherapy only caused gynecomastia in 36% of men with prostate cancer, whereas 100 to 200 mg/day bicalutamide caused it consistently in 78 to 79% of the men ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effects_of_bicalutamide#Incidences)).

During this cycle, which starts right after the initial feel good stage of the first 15 days, there are two main states that change when your testosterone levels change. The high energy state- the superpower state- is when your testosterone peaks and you feel amazing again. This state will expand the longer you abstain from pmo. The flatline- the low energy state- is when you feel anxious lethargic and impotent because of the lack of testosterone. This state will contract the longer you abstain from pmo. When the withdrawal process begins, your flatline state will last longer (8-10 days)than your superpower state (4-6 days). As you progress through the withdrawal stage, superpowers will last longer and flatlined with last shorter. By day 90, superpowers should last 10-15 days and flatlined should last 6-12 hours. By day 180, flatlines are almost none existent.",0.892810978,cameruption1332,"I can definitely relate to this.

The next day, I woke up with a terrible hangover and some shit in my underwear. WTF?  So she explains what happened. Turns out that during the night, I farted so loud it woke her up. Unfortunately, it wasnt just a fart. My girlfriend was sleeping next to me, woke up due to the smell and the noise, saw what happened (i was laying on my stomach) and then........  &amp;#x200B;  ........went back to sleep.

Plus it often takes time to fully suppress T. You'll still need to lower your T by about 80% though.  My suggestion would be to double estrogen and keep spiro at the current dose. If you absolutely want, then increase your spiro to a total of 150mg per day. Maybe 100mg in the morning plus 50mg in the evening.  Doubling your estrogen dose will increase your E and will also help to further lower your T.  I'd also suggest to get your next bloodtest in 1-2 months.

The only problem with an active investment like flipping houses or partnering in real estate developments is that my work is time intensive, and I am worried that I would not have sufficient time to give the project its due regard. It is also outside of my area of expertise, which has been a problem in past investments. I put money into a very credible oil investment, but got caught by plunging oil prices.   The amounts that I mentioned (500K to 1M) were net cash AFTER paying my ex wife each year. I have actually been happier with less, but I because I am not confident about where to put the money, I tend to take no action, the money sits there, and then I end up doing something less than perfect--like purchase a home that is more than I need.

After 20 min my ex called 911 again to say never mind.   I also hid the drinking from her.

But then he tore his ACL, and got a MONSTER contract (that he deserved at the time) and the last 2 years he's not bounced back. And honestly even if he did we need the cap for a QB.

My heroin use eventually started to fuck with my diet and lifting schedule, and I was getting out of shape  I used to love getting blasted and lifting for 3-4 hours, but opiate addiction just doesn't mix well with lifting.  It lowers your testosterone level, fucks with your digestive system, and it dehydrates you like mad.  But that's all secondary to the fact that proper, structured nutrition and exercise routines are not really compatible with addiction in the long-term.  I'm quite certain that using H for another 6-12 months would have resulted in me eventually stopping lifting altogether and saying fuck it about my diet.",0.892079671,wildbill59,"44yrs and -74 lbs in 3 /12 mo.I eat less than 20 net carbs everyday.

I try to explain things but shes too old to teach I guess. My dad can carry on for a little bit he has no investments or real understanding. I force my girlfriend to listen to me rant every once in a while and she will humor me for a little.   I find its best to just head online for people to talk to.

",0.891076133,ThisIsNotDre,"Reading through the Examine article and doing some more google research, it generally looks inconclusive if anything.  As mentioned, there is some evidence to suggest super-loading can lead to decreased testoserone, so if you plan to go 100% that's something to consider.  The ""is soy okay for men"" thing has been a debate for a while, so there's a lot of misinformation out there unfortunately. Overall though, years of research later and we're still not entirely sure. It's worth considering if you're really concerned about it. Otherwise, the best way to see how you are effected is to get your testosterone level measured now, and see how they change 1-2 months after using soylent.  The rule of nutrition seems to be everything in moderation. If you're using soylent to replace one of your meals or something, I wouldn't worry. Going over 50% soylent, if you're concerned track your test levels.  Personally, I'd prefer to see soylent use a variety of sources for their protein, instead of just rice protein, or just soy protein.",0.891125674,Gonzo034,"Not every time, but on Stubhub it's pretty common.

You're not the first to suggest stainless so I'm making that change.  I'm looking for a setup that's gonna outlast me, so maintenance is def a concern.  As for the plates: pricing out identical plates based on the ones I was looking at, I'm looking at $385+free shipping for the 260lbs set (2x10-15-25-35-45), and $379+148 shipping = $527 total to do 4x10,2x25,4x45.

It's not multi-player (at least for now - the expansion pack Don't Starve Together has been [annouced](http://blog.eu.playstation.com/2015/12/05/dont-starve-together-revealed-for-ps4/)) but it is a fantastic game. It's easy to learn, has easy basic controls that are always on screen when you need htem, it's really good fun and because you only get one life it can be fun to just see how far each of you can go (my wife just took it in turns and when we got better at it started saving and switching saves every 5 days).   * [Pure Pool](https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/pure-pool-ps4/) - quite a good little pool simulator, I got it for under £4 and the snooker expansion pack is a good rendition of snooker. Only any good if you both would enjoy a game of pool. Handy bonus - it can be pass-n-play if you only have one controller ",0.891068228,Wackyal123,"Hah! Trust me, I have anxiety. As far as I am aware, GAD. My mind accelerates situations out of control. I.e. If I don't get a good review at work, I'll get fired, then won't find another job, then will lose my house, then my wife will leave me and I'll never have children.   Yes... It got that bad, I had counselling this summer after losing a baby because I literally lost all the joy in my life. I felt empty. Now I just feel stressed and anxious about the coming year.
