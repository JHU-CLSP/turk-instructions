<h1>Instructions</h1>
<h2>Choose how likely an author belongs to the given in-group based on the comment. </h2>
<p><strong>Highly Likely</strong> The author belongs to the given in-group with high confidence. For example, authors who use "my kid","my daughter",etc. in their comments are highly likely to be parents</p>
<p><strong>Likely</strong> The author probably belongs to the given in-group. For example, authors who say "my PC" in their comments are probably gamers</p>
<p><strong>Hard to tell</strong> An author belonging to any in-group could use the phrase. For example, "my mom" is not a good phrase to decide whether an author is a gamer.</p>
